I'm not a hunter, but I do believe they have the same right as well, to hunt, assuming all rules are followed, just like a hobbyist gun owner.

While I understand that you have the belief that certain firearms are not needed, this is a bit of a dated argument as well, as anyone knows that is a firearm enthusiast, where there is a will there is a way, and given enough time, criminals will get what they want or need. Those that simply want to own various firearms should be allowed to, given they too follow the rules and regulations to own one.

Car accidents kill thousands of people every year and to be able to drive a vehicle, you must pass multiple tests (written and behind the wheel), pass safety requirements (vision test), and submit to ongoing checks if you wish to be able to retain the ability to drive (renewing your license). To me, this system is the least we can do for guns. Pass basic skill tests, basic safety tests, on going oversight, etc. before being able to take a gun instead of the short waiting period could be enough to stop some mass shootings. It isn't the only answer but it may be part of the answer.

The sole purpose of firearms is to cause harm or kill other living things, regardless of whether or not it is self protection.

There have been countless shootings from our children's schools to your local shopping center, and enough is enough. 

The argument that Americans should own guns to protect others and themselves in these situations is also baseless.

In fact, we are now actually hearing that civilians feel the need to take the law into their own hands by shooting to kill, which is not even something that police officers should be allowed to do.

"Even given a basic knowledge of gun regulation, when it comes to gun control laws, 2 things scream out at me, blatantly apparent: 1. that there is a critical need for stricter gun laws and 2. these laws to not need to impede on an Americans right to bear arms. Yes, we can all win; we can improve safety and curb violence and, crucially, we can uphold our right to bear arms. 
     Frequently-as with so many other issues-the matter of gun laws is painted (typically by the media) in tones of black and white, which is, frankly, ridiculous. Gun owners understandably get worried that someone will take their guns or make their current firearms illegal, and any laws need to be sensitive to that. But there should be basic, common sense changes to screening measures and waiting periods, and these changes need not effect current gun owners or impede our basic rights.  
     Specifically, we always do background checks, screening for mental illness, and any felonies; one should not be able to go to a gun show and walk away with a weapon. We should consider extending the waiting period, and mandating that guns are better kept away from children. We should consider inacting a law that any individual wanting to own an assault weapon must have a permit (similar to the conceal and carry permit). We should consider making large drum type magazines for assault weapons illegal. However, it is crucial to note that every current gun owner should be grandfathered in and not subject to these laws when it comes to their currently owned firearms (as in, they are exempt from legislation for their current weapons). They should, under no circumstances, have to give up their currently owned arms, and no right should be given to any law enforcement or other agency to seize them under new legislation. Further, there should be a introductory phase of new legislation totalling at least a year wherein the laws are slowly being introduced. Gun owners need to be held accountable for their disgruntled kids shooting up schools, and no, that shouldn't mean that you can't go hunting with your boy.
     Such laws would not impede on the rights of gun owners while also increasing gun safety. We can no longer ignore that guns are falling into the wrong hands. Disgruntled kids especially are shooting up schools to the point that it is quite ridiculous; kids should not go to school afraid of dying. Other deranged individuals and gangs can (and do) obtain assault weapons and wreak havok. We need to do whatever we can to keep guns away from them. Of course guns don't kill people, people kill people, but making it harder for these individuals to obtain weapons will have a positive effect. It is not the cure all for this situation, and we need to take a hard look at underlying causes in the case of kids shooting up schools (personally I think social media and bullying needs a hard look), perhaps consider mental health evaluations for high risk kids and make those that ignore the warning signs accountable. But we need to do everything we can to curb the violence; kids should not be dying because a gun owner can't keep their weapons adequately locked up, or because a mentally ill individual can go to a gun show and walk away with a weapon of war.",3,5,4,Low Utility,Democrat,correct,2,27.666666666666668,54.5,27.5,1,1,2.25,Republican,0,3,6,3,3,41,41,48,61,30,25,correct,0,37,ef8198aa,8.91444866920152,3,5,4,3,5,4,27.666666666666668
"I don't think that you want that guns should be banned from private citizens.  I don't think that either.  I don't think anyone would object to less people dying while people could still own and use guns.  That's why a few well designed restrictions on on gun purchasing could still allow people to have, use, and own firearms, but reduce the death toll of gun balance. 

 First, a waiting period doesn't hurt legitimate gun users.  It would stop people from making rash reactions, particularly as suicide is often a use of guns.  People with legitimate needs to have concealed weapons could still have them - they would just have to plan ahead some. Second, buying massive firepower doesn't seem to have any use in ""self-defense"".  Large cases and fully automatic rifles don't seem compatible with sport usage or self defense.  finally, background checks to make sure that people with criminal backgrounds or mental health problems will help keep guns out of the wrong hands.

"While all Americans enjoy the rights of our Second Amendment, which is that 'a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed' it is important to remember the context of that amendment.  It is prudent to remember that this amendment was written in 1789, a time when arms were limited to flintlocks and muskets. A musket could shoot one round at a time, at most up to 3 or 4 rounds in a minute.  Today, people are more apt to possess an AR-15 that has a magazine capacity of 30 rounds that can be discharged at 45 rounds per minute.  

There is no comparison between these firearms, and sadly, the language in the second amendment has not kept up with the times. While it may be acceptable for our military establishments to use semi-automatic and automatic weapons, there is really no reason to afford such use to your average, run of the mill citizen.  

It would also be important to remember that in 1789, the term Militia was used to define the commonplace ""citizens armies"" used at the time.   These ""Militias"" were volunteer citizens who formed their own ""army"" to help defend America.  These ""Militias"" went by the wayside
as the US Army became a more recognized military force.  Today, we have a very substantial military force in America that is comprised of the Army, Marines, Air Force, Navy and National Guard serviced by enlisted men. Most of the ""militias"" in American today are self formed vigilanted groups that are concerned with a shared cause that may not reflect the views of all Americans.  

Keeping these facts in mind, it is clearly obvious that the right to bear arms does not mean that the ordinary US citizen can, nor should, own any type of arms they can purchase.  One must question why such fire power is needed to protect one's own home when we have local law enforcement to do this.",3,1,3,Low Utility,Democrat,correct,2,0.3333333333333333,50,0,2,1,2,Republican,0,1,7,2,2,0,0,50,50,0,0,correct,0,40,37a437d6,-13.08555133079848,2,3,3,2.5,2,3,0.3333333333333333

In rural areas, having guns is a necessity because of the wildlife that we live with daily.

People in rural areas are more reliant on themselves for self protection. The police are often a long way off and cannot respond in time for emergencies. Rural people are often hunters as well.
People in different areas of the country have different needs and opinions and deserve different gun laws to address those needs. Therefore they should be able to write those laws without interference from the federal government.
The 2nd Amendment should be interpreted expansively enough so that individual states can make their own decisions.

"First the 2nd Amendment starts, ""A well regulated militia..."" It doesn't mention everyone should be able to own a gun. It states ""regulated"" which means laws and restrictions and militia which isn't ""private citizens"". This indicates to me our founders wanted regulation for guns and when writing in was a pre-industrial society where men had to hunt for food and needed guns, so as our need to hunt for food receded and we became more urban less need for guns so more regulations would improve safety.

If you look at the US vs. any other Western Country, our gun death rates are obscene, compared to almost every other Western nation with much stricter laws restricting firearms. Many states don't even have limits for mentally ill people or others who shouldn't have a gun and this causes death and suffering. The need for multi round AK-47's and such are just designed to kill people en mass and should be outlawed.

For example the insane can still buy a gun at a gun show or from a private gun owner without any sort of real background checks. Also many terrorists get many guns from international gun dealers and use those guns in crimes in our country by making use of loose gun controls laws here.

As a matter of fact, criminals don't buy guns from gun stores at all. They don't care about guns laws; otherwise, they wouldn't be criminals.

"It is a proven fact mass shootings in America is a common thing.  While some may argue that by increasing the difficulty required to obtaining legal guns is impeding on our freedom to bear amrs, I would strongly disagree.  There are many ways to protect oneself that does not require the use of a gun, martial arts for instance.  Better yet avoiding violence all together would be the ideal goal by using verbal skills and attempting to deescalate rather than shooting first and relying on stand your ground laws later.
  Thinking about the problem as a whole guns do indeed kill people and makes it far to easy to kill especially in a moment of anger or being a tempting solution to solve problems by individuals with mental health issues.  I think we can all agree by now that the laws we have right now are not working and make it far too easy for anybody to obtain a gun.  We need to further restrict the sale of guns no matter the cost or the mass shooting will continue, it is only a matter of what day of the week it happens.  Relying on guns to solve problems is NOT a solution and obtaining them all together needs to be reserved for trained professionals with longer and extremely thorough background checks, and if there is even the slightest hint of an unstable tendencies within an individual they should be denied, no workarounds or loopholes.

"It is important to impose stricter gun laws, because it is far too easy to obtain guns in most states. The amount of people who own guns and are not mentally fit to own one is alarming. There needs to be stricter background checks, required gun safety courses, waiting periods, and more regulations for guns on the market. In the US, there are many people who are mentally unfit, domestic abusers, or suicidal who slip through the cracks and are able to easily purchase guns. We must develop better systems and laws to decrease these people from easily and legally obtaining guns.

I have a serious concern about person to person sales vs gun dealer to customer transactions. These person to person sales worry me and I do not believe it is right to allow this type of undocumented sale of guns.

"Stricter gun laws will not infringe on your ability to own a gun. Rather, they will ensure that all gun owners are responsible members of our society, who can be trusted with lethal weapons. As you certainly know, guns can be very dangerous. Estimates suggest that almost 40 thousands American lives were lost to gun violence last year. When the U.S. sanctions gun sales to violent people, they enable gun violence. Thus, it is imperative that we strengthen background checks in this country.

Background checks and other measures are already present in our society. For example, one must go through a rigorous process in order to secure Sudafed. Additionally, I often struggle to access my prescribed medication, Xanax, as it is often abused by some people. What do these have in common?

"We can all agree on certain issues when it comes to gun laws. No one wants a gun in the hands of anyone who wants to harm children. Everyone is outraged when an innocent child has been shot while playing or, as recently happened, shot while sitting on their porch. No one condones school shootings. No one condones domestic abusers having guns or mentally ill people getting their hands on guns. No one is okay with criminals having guns. The question is how can we make it so those don't have access to guns while still protecting the rights of people who want to hunt and feel the need to protect their families? With what is going on in American society today, the last point is the most relevant. 

In the US we are have many gun laws on the books but they don't always work. Criminals certainly don't follow the laws and others manage to get a gun when they shouldn't be able to. People who are uninformed of the laws and uniformed about what a gun can do believe that taking them all away is the answer but it isn't because criminals will always get guns. They are criminals because they don't follow the laws. Lately, the police have been so busy with the rioters and looters that the time it takes for them to respond has dramatically increased in these cities. There is also the problem with misinformation.  Fear mongers report inaccurate information about the performance of guns and claim it's so easy to purchase one just to scare people who don't know any better. Some of the inaccurate information includes that  AR in AR15 stands for 'automatic rifle.'  It doesn't. It stands for ArmaLite Rifle Model 15. AR-15s are not automatic weapons and can't shoot 100 rounds a second (another falsehood I've read online). Many people use them for target shooting and varmint hunting. Another scare tactic fear mongers use is that it's so easy to buy a gun, you can order one off the internet and have it delivered to your house. This is patently false. All guns sales from businesses must go through a licensed dealer. The buyer has to fill out a form that is faxed into the ATF where their information is run through their database to make sure the person isn't a felon or not legally allowed to own a gun for some other reason. Gun dealers are very careful to follow the law because if they break it, they are held accountable and can be sentenced to jail for a long time. 

Are there problems with today's gun laws? Yes, there are regulations that can be tightened but there are some that are really problematic. How do we keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill people when the health care privacy laws forbids sharing health information? On the other hand, if we allow psychiatrists to inform on mentally ill people, will someone who is having a problem refuse treatment because they are afraid that the information won't be kept secure? Almost everyone has been the victim of a data breach nowadays. How can we ensure that the mental health problems someone suffered in the past won't affect their ability to obtain a job or health insurance in the future? We want people to get help but many will refuse if they are afraid their privacy will be violated. So, I think we can all agree that their are some areas of gun laws that need to be researched.

"I think every responsible adult in our country wants to see our neighborhoods, our schools, our places of worship and other public gathering spaces safer.  The spate of gun violence, whether gangs or mass murdering, or school shooting is disturbing to all of us, gun owners and not.  While I do not personally own a gun, I have fired and trained with them, and have family members who own them.  I respect them as a weapons, not toys, that need to be trained with, educated upon, and protected from falling in the wrong hands, whether they be people with dangerous intentions, the young, or the irresponsible.
So what can we, as like minded people who want to see less gun violence do to work towards this common goal.  The second amendment guarantees American citizens the right to bear arms.

As a country, we must foster an environment that proper gun ownership and care is considered the pinnacle of patriotism.  And part of this is for our laws to be stricter, to keep more guns from reaching trigger fingers who should not handle them.

Most people who argue for less strict laws are using the second amendment as the basis for their argument.

No normal member of society needs these types of weapons. 
There also needs to be more background checks.

2) Mass murderers prefer easy/soft targets and with stricter gun laws.  Places like schools and churches would be easily deemed to not have weapons and be easy targets for these horrible people.

The point that most importantly proves my point right, however, is the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Too many people have been shot and killed, just because of their skin color. This serves as perfect proof that guns are being used in the wrong ways.

I believe that it is alright to use guns, but that one should do so, only when it is appropriate to do so, such as in war, to shoot someone who did something VERY bad to one, or to defend oneself. We should have stricter gun laws so that fewer people would use guns inappropriately.

"Gun laws in this country need to be stricter than they are currently. This has been demonstrated by the high increase in mass murders by people who should have never been able to own a gun much less use it to destroy so many lives.

Yes, there is a second amendment that gives every citizen the right to bear arms. But please remember when this was written and by who. At the time it was determined that bearing arms was a necessity in life. A gun was needed to provide food for a family, protect the shelter that was built to house that family, and to protect oneself and loved ones from various criminals and dangers that existed at that time. 

We are living in very different times and circumstances. Most of us do not hunt for our food, and we have security systems protecting our homes and our cares. We also live in a time filled with stress that has had a serious impact on our mental health and well being. We are inundated by media that portrays violence as something that is a game not an end to life. It causes children to become desensitized to the idea that killing is something to avoid, taking a life should not be the way to settle disagreements and it has become that in our cities and towns. 

There has to be an end to this madness and loss of life and stricter gun control laws are a sensible way to do this. Honest, law abiding citizens without a history of untreated mental illness would still find it easy to purchase firearms. Yes, it would require a short waiting period to be approved and licensed. Why is there a rush to buy a firearm unless you were doing so in the heat of an argument with someone or an irrational fear brought on by an underlying mental illness?

Imposing stricter gun laws doesn't necessarily mean that you can no longer use a gun for hunting or recreational purposes, it just means that there would be stricter regulations in place to insure that the gun owner is a person who uses firearm in a safe and responsible manner. Additionally, this would also mean that lethal military assault weaponry would become banned as it is unjustifiable to carry such guns for general purposes. This compromise would ensure that people are safer but still have the ability to use a less-lethal gun. 

It is written in our constitution that we as U.S. citizens have the right to bare arms. Despite this, we can still do so without using military weaponry that has the power to do more harm than good. With proper regulations and guns, people would still be able to practice the second amendment freely in a safe manner.",3,3,6,High Utility,Democrat,correct,3,0.3333333333333333,20,0,1,1,1,Republican,0,1,5,3,1,0,0,30,10,0,0,correct,1,130,b2de0017,-5.085551330798481,3,4,6,3,3.5,6,0.3333333333333333

With stricter laws, not everyone will be able to defend themselves.

"Among the many hot topics across the US right now includes how strict our gun laws should be. While proponents of having looser gun laws say that stricter gun laws will infringe on their rights to bear arms and the second amendment there are those that favor much stricter gun laws. Their reasoning includes that the US have by far the most gun deaths in the world and that is because our gun laws are so loose and that firearms are readily available for those who want to purchase them. In very few parts of the world can citizens obtain not only firearms but high powered rifles. As a result we have school shootings, we have mall shootings and we have mass killings in our country. 

While I don't believe we should altogether get rid of guns, I do believe we should all give up high powered rifles meant for military use as there really is no need for them. It would solve having so many mass killings and would not allow these people to walk into our malls, movie theaters, and schools and unloading an automatic weapon into our parents, siblings, sons and daughters. I believe that purchasing guns should be a lot harder as well and while I understand that many want to keep their right to bear arms, making it harder to have guns does not stop this. Protecting yourself and your family should not require an automatic rifle and if you want to do so you still have the right just with an extreme background check so that these killings can stop.

"The United States currently has the highest per capita gun ownership in the world. Gun ownership stems from colonial days when it was intended for militias.  The second amendment is not an unlimited right for individuals to own guns. Our founding fathers surely did not intend for us to own large gun caches or automatic weapons capable of mass destruction.
More gun control laws will result in less gun deaths. The UK with strict laws against guns has 160 times less gun deaths than the US. Guns are the leading cause of death from homicides and suicides.  Greater gun control would result in less suicide deaths, less accidental gun deaths, and less domestic violence deaths.
Many gun owners claim they have their guns for self defense.  But guns are rarely used for self defense.  Studies show that less than 1% of victims of violent crime protect themselves with a gun.  Guns tend to escalate conflicts into dangerous situations. Further, legally owned guns can and are stolen and used by criminals.
In summary, gun control laws would prevent countless deaths and significantly reduce the costs to society of treating the 100K + individuals who fall victim to gun violence each and every year.

I shouldn't read in the news that a 17-year-old kid drove through state lines with an assault rifle with the intention of harming people. And of course, our lovely president tries to defend him. How is anyone supposed to take us seriously if our own president doesn't care if white kids are driving across state lines with guns? I shouldn't be afraid to send my child to school with the thought of a school shooting possibly happening. It's freighting for everyone.

"I want to start by saying that I understand your point of view. I understand why you are passionate about gun control and wish to support stronger gun laws. I remember well a day in high school in which I heard about the shooting at Columbine in 1999 and have always remembered that day as the first time I ever even thought about gun control. We want to protect our children, our students and ourselves. And stronger gun laws seem like the logical step towards that goal, but I ask you to consider another side. 
First, it is critical that we acknowledge that the right to bear arms is written explicitly in our Constitution. We, as citizens of this country, have a right to protect ourselves with firearms. Now, some of you may even agree that this is our right but state that when the Constitution was written, there were no guns like we see today. It is noteworthy that guns that are classified as assault weapons/automatic/semi-automatic seem to be blurred and lumped together when discussing gun control. Many who are not familiar with these types of guns may hear the word ""automatic"" even when speaking of semi-automatics and imagine nonstop machine fire. Would these same people opposed to assault rifles or semi-automatics also be opposed to a shotgun or hand rifle? 
Another point to consider is that regardless of gun laws or how strict they may be, guns will still be obtained illegally to commit crimes. Take a close look at the number of gang-related shootings in an area such as Chicago, for instance. Take a look at how many of those guns were purchased legally as opposed to being obtained illegally. And then, take a look at gun-related deaths and violence in those areas compared to others. Numbers do not lie.
Though your heart is in the right place to bring stricter gun regulations, the truth is that until we recognize that gun violence has deeper roots, it will not stop. It does not matter how hard it will be to obtain a gun legally. If someone wants to cause harm, they will find a way. The questions need to go to the uncomfortable and difficult places that many of you do not want to turn to. It is easy to point to single events such as Columbine as examples of why we need stricter gun laws. But consider that these events, as horrific as they are, pale in comparison of the daily shootings that occur every single day in this country. These shootings do not make the headlines. Ask yourself why.",2,5,3,High Utility,Republican,correct,1,14.666666666666666,41.5,50,1,1,1,Democrat,1,1,2,2,3,19,24,41,42,50,50,correct,1,136,524825ac,-10.08555133079848,1,5,4,1.5,5,3.5,14.666666666666666
"First off, I would just like to say that in no way, shape, or form is the government or anyone else going to take your guns away. Your second amendment right to bare arms is not at risk. The only thing people that support gun control want to accomplish is to make it harder for people who shouldn't be using guns, like people with untreated mental illnesses and terrorists, from getting them.

The main way to do that is stricter background checks. And my questions to gun rights supporters is this: if you have nothing in your background to worry about, why does it matter if you have to wait two weeks instead of one to get a gun?  Isn't the safety of our kids at school and public places more important? What is that extra week going to cost you? Chances are you already have multiple guns to use if you want to hunt or have target practice. Your arguments against this logic make no sense. 

And remember, your right to own a gun does not out weigh someone else's right to live. Americans claim to be a Christian country with Christian values, and one of the most important tenets of Christianity is to look out for the health and safety of those around you. Now sometimes that might mean having firearms for protection, but I find it hard to believe that an arsenal that resembles a military storage bunker is necessary.

"When laws are passed about gun regulation, you are hindering on not only violating the 2nd amendment, but you are also making innocent citizens weaker. We have the right to protect ourselves and defend our property. By making it harder for the average citizen to acquire protection, he is at risk and a lesser American.

The belief that tightening regulation to prevent criminals and mental patients from getting access to such weapons is false. Criminals by definition, breaks laws to acquire their goals. We see in the UK, Australia, and in several other countries that more regulations does not correlate to lower crime. The amount of violence and weapon use actually increase because more people can't defend themselves. Additionally, even when a total ban was enacted in the UK, they now have a knife problem that mirror gun violence rates.",3,1,4,Low Utility,Republican,correct,1,0.3333333333333333,0,2,1,1,1.25,Democrat,1,2,1,2,3,0,0,0,0,1,3,correct,0,138,dafb484f,-5.085551330798481,3,3,3,3,2,3.5,0.3333333333333333
"I completely understand why Republicans would want less strict gun laws, or not want a change to existing gun laws. We have a constitutional amendment written specifically understanding a person's right to carry arms; there is a well-understood ""slippery slope"" argument made positing that gun laws are aimed at slowly but surely undermining a citizen's right to own firearms outright. However, there would be many benefits to supporting stricter gun laws than what are in place currently.
  First and foremost, stricter gun laws would help republicans gain favor with democrats in regards to their ""moral image"". More and more recently, mass shootings have become a reality for many americans through television and news media. By favoring stricter gun laws, Republicans can show the country they care about this issue and want to do what they can to help prevent future shootings. Secondly, stricter gun laws will help support the idea that guns truly only belong in the hands of those responsible of those using them. This plays into the previous point, that many shooters have accessed weapons from relatives or others with unsecured weapons. By supporting stricter gun laws, republicans can solidify themselves as a party that truly believes in responsible gun ownership.",3,1,2,High Utility,Democrat,correct,2,3.6666666666666665,5,15,3,1,3,Republican,1,1,6,4,2,5,5,5,5,20,10,correct,1,139,3b90a69a,5.914448669201519,3,3,3,3,2,2.5,3.6666666666666665
"The argument for stricter gun laws tends to be one that aims at keeping people safer by restricting access to guns. Studies, however, will show that most gun violence is committed by those who do not legally seek to obtain firearms. Episodes of mass violence with a firearm rarely take place from someone who has legally obtained that firearm, meaning that stricter gun laws will not solve the issue. Instead, we should seek to focus efforts on providing better mental health coverage.

If we want to stop gun violence, we should not worry so much about gun owners who follow the rules. They rarely are the perpetrators of fun violence. The problem is not with guns, but instead with a mental health epidemic in this country. It is, therefore, more important to focus our efforts on mental health iniatives instead of stricter gun laws.",2,1,2,Low Utility,Republican,correct,1,8.666666666666666,67,28,1,2,1.5,Democrat,0,1,2,3,2,11,13,65,69,21,35,correct,0,140,d1df3ca5,-12.08555133079848,1,2,2,1.5,1.5,2,8.666666666666666
"Our Constitution permits our citizens to keep and bare arms.  Rather than add new laws concerning gun control, Congress should empower our law enforcement officers to uphold the laws that are already in place.  Adding new laws, if they are not enforced, will not solve anything.  If Congress passes new gun control laws, it will only enable criminals and illegals to have guns.  Restricting sales only drives the gun market underground and law-abiding citizens will not be able to protect themselves.

I firmly believe that every citizen should be required to take and pass a training course on gun safety and current gun laws.  These courses should be provided in accordance with our laws and free for a nominal fee.  A Certificate should be awarded to those who complete the courses and then presented to the gun dealer when purchasing a gun.

The problem is more that undiagnosed mentally disturbed individuals are acquiring weapons.

I can certainly understand your point of view on increasing restrictions on gun laws. There have been horrific tragedies in recent years. There have been a number of school shootings, gun violence in the streets continues. However, the answer is to address mental illness and the things that cause it.

"The purpose of gun laws is to make sure that who do not meet the requirements of gun ownership are not able to acquire any gun or firearm that is included in the laws of this country and its states. The ability for someone to cross state lines to acquire a gun they could not get in their home state due to stricter laws is something that should not be happening. Yes this sounds like a pro-stricter gun laws but in truth it is not.
     Careful evaluation of what laws are currently on the books would show that there was and is a concerted effort to restrict the sales of guns to those persons that do not meet the requirements of gun ownership per state and federal standards. The problem is that the laws are not uniform, meet a standard across the board and are not upheld in some cases. A gun sale can be between neighbors, family, gun show or local big box store. Some have minimum wait restrictions and some do not observe or have a wait restriction before someone walks off with a gun.  
     Before you vote in favor of stricter gun laws, do the research and create programs or features that will make the current laws which are tough enough when enforced and make the gun laws function as there were first proposed to do.

"Stricter gun laws are not effective for their most often cited reasons for being implemented: reducing crime. Additionally, stricter gun laws are likely to be constitutional, even if desired by certain populaces in the United States. Therefore, for both economic and constitutional reasons, there should be less gun control laws in the United States. 

First, there has been no correlation to lower crime rates and jurisdictions that have strict gun controls laws in the United States. First, we will disregard international comparisons to other countries because no country has the social and economic history of the United States and availability of firearms as here. Second, there has been no prevailing lower crime rates because of the continued availability and ease of access to firearms in jurisdictions that don't have strict gun laws to those that do. As long as there remain jurisdictions with easy firearms access, there will be no reason to have strict gun laws.

"Imagine, if you will, the date of December 14, 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut. The horror-driven image of parents' dreadful sorrow as their babies are wheeled from Sandy Hook Elementary on stretchers, less are responsive than not. Now, imagine a nightclub in Orlando, Florida on June 12, 2016. Many youths and young couples distraught after friends and family have been executed, point-blank by a sole gunman. So much heartache brought about by just a couple of individuals. What do these two scenarios have in common? Both massacres were conducted through the use of guns, yes, but perhaps at the root of the issue, more could have been done from a preventative stand-point. Many legislatures and Americans today feel that the limitation and removal of gun ownership from the general populace would circumvent these issues, and while it may very well achieve this, oftentimes the alternative consequences of such actions are overlooked and disregarded. I don't think any American in their right mind would defend the actions of these individuals that dub such heinous acts of senseless violence as a reasonable thing to do. I also believe that most Americans would want such individuals prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law so that justice may be carried out and the loved ones of the victims can at least have some sense of closure that the perpetrator will not be able to harm anyone ever again. I believe much of the  conflict comes with what kind of preventative measures to enact to address the problem, only the problem, and nothing else. That said, I do not believe gun laws should grow any stricter than they are today.  

The individuals that resort to these evil mass killings are known to have a history of mental trauma. I think mental health needs to take on a bigger role in society at large. From combat veterans to traumatized children, we as a society need to be better equipped to treat those in fragile mental states. School guidance counselors' roles should be revised to help reinforce ethics and good stress-handling practices in our youths, instead of pushing on the burden of finding and engaging in post-secondary education. The use of psychiatrists and psychologists should be normalized in our everyday life, and not just limited to the mentally distressed. It would be interesting to see a cross-industry push for human resource representatives to encourage the use of such practices on a frequent basis. With modern technology and advances in the field, mental health safeguards should be easy to put into place at varying places in different individuals' lives. 

Secondly, while more strict gun laws would stop mass deaths as a result of the use of guns, I believe more harm than good would come from disarming the public. Individuals will show no lack of creativity when it comes to harming others. While guns may not be a viable or easy answer any longer, arson, bombs, poison, and vehicular manslaughter will always remain easy ways to cause lots of harm. If the issue can be transformed to another media of violence, then the legislation of further restricting gun ownership will not solve the root of the problem. Additionally, outside of major metropolitan areas in rural and even some suburban communities, the main deterrent for crime is personal gun ownership. The reason for this is that the community stretches over far too much land for the population to be successfully be patrolled by a police force of any sort. These regions of the country in which most Americans do live would be significantly put in danger by limitations in the ability to protect oneself. I believe that putting more individuals into place with guns and proper training would actually help prevent some of these shootings from taking place. Whether its an armed school resource officer, or armed security at a nightclub, it is a sensible solution to fix the problem and not harm anyone else.",3,5,3,High Utility,Republican,correct,1,26.333333333333332,21,43.5,2,1,1.5,Democrat,0,1,5,2,2,41,37,18,24,34,53,correct,1,165,d9d2ed1c,22.91444866920152,3,5,3,3,5,3,26.333333333333332

The focus should instead be on enforcing the already existing laws to ensure compliance. If criminal history reports were filed with a national database, and this database was queried before any sale of a firearm, it would greatly reduce the mistakes that occur and prevent unlawful possession of firearms. Furthermore, education should be introduced into schools about firearm safety.

"I recognize that you may be in support of less strict gun laws because you fear that this may mean you may not qualify to purchase guns or keep the guns you already own. However, that is not the intent of these laws. These laws do not oppose entire ownership of guns to keep in your home and protect yourself or use to hunt. These laws simply need to exist to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands and harming innocent people. If you are someone who seeks to own guns for non-violent, non-homicidal, non-terroristic reason, then you should have nothing to worry about.
We can simply look at data collected from other countries to determine whether or not stricter gun laws are better at preventing more homicides. It has been found that fewer guns in the home is actually the more logical answer. Being heavily armed within your own home does not protect you from someone else with a gun. Ideally, stricter gun laws would even prevent the criminals from having a gun in the first place making your possession irrelevant.

The best starting point would be background checks on all types of gun purchases, regardless of where it happens or who it is from.

Needing a license to carry a firearm, with a gun safety and gun use course required in order to obtain it will ensure that anyone who obtains a gun is someone who will use it safely and wisely.

In today's era -- 200 plus years after the Constitution was enacted -- firearms are magnitudes more deadly in that they can cause much more destruction than the muskets that were used in the 1700s. If one of today's firearms gets into the hands of an unstable individual untold carnage is often the result. The mass shootings of the past few decades is proof of this.

Guns are used criminally by criminals.  That means they are using them outside of the law.  No amount of lawmaking is going to hinder criminals from getting guns.

"There are countless cases in the United States of incidents where people who own guns are fatally wounding themselves and others. I feel the United States would be a better place with stricter gun laws because not everyone is mentally stable enough to own a gun. The simple fact is that bad people with guns results in the more deaths of innocent people. This is evident in the mass shootings that are happening each year. You could ask yourself how are they getting these guns and high capacity magazines. Making gun laws more strict will allow more qualified people without mental disorders to own guns which will prevent the deaths of more innocent people. 

Making gun laws less strict results in innocent people being shot for no reason and more and more guns on the streets than there should be. When there are more guns then children have access to them and are more likely capable of shooting themselves. Also stricter gun laws are needed to protect women from domestic abusers and stalkers. Some people use guns to intimidate others who refuse to go along with there program. More gun control laws would reduce gun deaths making communities much safer. I think it's beneficial to own a gun but not everyone should have access to them. If anyone on the street can just go in a shop and get a gun then this is not good at all.

"We should have stricter gun laws in America. This doesn't mean taking everyone's guns away. This means regulating who has access to guns and what kind of guns they can have. 

There should be better background checks on people seeking to obtain guns. Many shootings have taken place because individuals were able to purchase to guns when they should not have been able to based on their mental health and criminal history. Citizens also should not be able to have access to machine guns. Self-defense is often touted as a reason for having guns, but there is no need for someone to have a machine gun for self-defense.

Speaking of self-defense, another argument in opposition to gun control is that if people are armed, they can take control in a mass-shooting situation or terrorist attack. This has not been the case. There have been many instances where a mass shooting has occurred, and people in the crowd have in fact been armed but the shooter was not gunned down.

"I'm sure you want there to be less gun deaths in America. I'm sure you don't want people to behave in reckless ways with firearms that make responsible gun owners like yourself look bad. I think there are some small changes we can make to the gun laws in this country that would increase safety, promote responsible use of guns, and not unfairly limit the exercise of the 2nd amendment.

First of all, the issue of assault rifles. They were used in 86% of mass shootings because they are so good at what they were designed for (mass killing). Surely we can agree the average American does not need a military style weapon for any lawful activity they would engage in. They were banned for 10 years and mass shootings decreased, and no one felt like their rights were being infringed during those ten years because, honestly, no one needed military grade weapons. I'm sure we agree we don't want another Las Vegas shooter incident where 500 people are shot, something that simply couldn't happen without assault rifles.

Second of all, background checks and waiting periods. A super majority of Americans think background checks are a good idea, to prevent criminals and people with documented mental or violence issues from easily obtaining weapons that may be used to harm themselves or others.",3,3,2,High Utility,Democrat,correct,3,33.666666666666664,50,41,2,1,1.75,Republican,0,4,5,4,1,51,49,49,51,42,40,correct,1,242,aee66000,11.91444866920152,2,3,1,2.5,3,1.5,33.666666666666664
"The topic of gun laws has become really controversial in the last few years. The reason being that guns have been the focus of so many tragedies all over the country. It is unfortunate that shooting happen at all, especially at churches and schools. Democrats and Republicans alike lament this issue and want it to stop. It's just that both sides approach it differently. I understand the sentiments behind wanting more gun control. I understand that Democrats see it as the best way to better society and keep people safe. But while I understand it, I don't agree with it because the 2nd amendment is so important in preserving our current republic and without it, civilians cannot protect themselves from many dangerous situations. It also means that civilians cannot protect themselves from the government if it were to become too powerful.

I think that the approach the US is taking to gun control is all wrong.  We should examine why these shootings are happening in the first place. Many kids are bullied at school and we know that bullying can contribute to antisocial behavior. We also know that many kids are neglected at home or experience abuse from their families. It is what is happening to children and families that is causing the uptick in shootings, not the guns themselves. I am all for gun safety and education but I think the problem here in America is a people problem. We need to fix our families and schools first. We need to be more empathetic to one another and focusing on helping those that are socially disadvantaged. We need better rehabilitation programs. If we focus on social change, we won't even need gun control.

Proponents of the second amendment rights also use this as a reason to bear arms, however, they neglect the part where one of the basic tenets is an organized militia. It is true that people are entitled to protect themselves from other people who intend to bring harm to them. But for citizens to walk the streets with weapons claiming to protect properties and business is taking it to another level. I believe that's why we have the police. In most developing countries, even the regular police use less lethal weapons rather than arms. It takes special training to bear arms. Why people need to die needlessly at the hands of careless citizens remains a conundrum  to me.

Limits on bumpstocks and very high capacity magazines are also a common sense measure, since these features are only useful during mass-shooting events, not legitimate firearm uses like self-defense or hunting.

   another reason democrats should be in favor of less strict gun laws is because stricter gun control does not keep guns out of the hands of criminals. criminals will find a way to get a weapon to cause harm. there are way too many illegal gun dealers that criminals can buy a gun from off the street. strict gun laws don't mean less guns. strict gun laws mean less good people are able to buy guns. less good people to defend their homes and families.",3,3,2,Low Utility,Republican,correct,1,13.666666666666666,51,41,1,1,1,Democrat,1,1,2,2,3,20,20,51,51,50,32,correct,0,249,5bf553cc,-5.085551330798481,3,3,2,3,3,2,13.666666666666666

"It may seem as though stricter background checks could infringe on your rights and prevent you from being able to participate in your hobbies or defend your family and property. In fact, if that is all you want to do, and you don't have a violent criminal record, you don't have anything to worry about - these kinds of background checks are aimed at preventing the wrong sorts of people from obtaining guns. People who advocate for stricter gun control simply want to make this process more accurate and more efficient. Nobody wants to prevent you from defending your family - but they do want to reduce the risks, the number of people out there who your family might need defending from.
You might say that that's all very well and good, but if guns are illegal that isn't going to prevent criminals from using them, since they are already breaking the law. And it's possible for a poorly implemented law to lead to that. But there are other options. High fines and increased sentences can deter criminals from using guns. If armed robbery with a gun has a higher sentence than other kinds of robbery - and of course, thievery where the criminal does not try to confront anyone - fewer criminals will use guns, fewer situations will be escalated to the point where shots are fired, and fewer people will die. 
There is an idea that ""one good guy with a gun"" can take down a mass shooter. It's possible, but unlikely. A mass shooter does not need to be trained.

Officers of the law arriving on the scene will also need to be able to distinguish between multiple armed civilians with guns, but have no real way of knowing at a glance which is the perpetrator and which is a ""good guy"", which interferes with their operations, could lead to more deaths in the meantime, and puts them in greater danger.",3,2,4,High Utility,Democrat,correct,3,0.3333333333333333,20,49.5,1,1,1,Republican,1,1,4,2,1,0,0,21,19,51,48,correct,1,251,e644661b,18.91444866920152,3,3,4,3,2.5,4,0.3333333333333333

There is evidence that a ""good guy with a gun"" very rarely prevents a bad guy with a gun. For example, the armed security guard involved in the Parkland shooting did not apprehend the shooter. And, there is research to suggest that having a gun in the house actually puts members of the household more at risk, because guns are more often used for suicide (or murder-suicide) than they are for self-defense. In fact, guns are one of the top methods of committing suicide. 

For this reason, it is especially important that people with known mental health issues or violent tendencies should not be allowed to access guns. Strict background checks, as well as laws that allow authorities or family members to legally and temporarily confiscate guns from people who pose a threat to themselves or others, will help to prevent dangerous people from accessing guns. These laws will not prevent law-abiding citizens from having access to guns - only people who pose a threat. However, if fewer dangerous people have access to guns, then there will be a lower need to have a gun for personal safety.",3,2,4,High Utility,Democrat,correct,2,10,40,27.5,2,1,2.5,Republican,0,1,5,4,2,9,20,41,39,25,30,correct,1,257,744388bc,-5.085551330798481,3,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,10
"I understand the desire to loosen the restrictions on guns. Shooting, whether it be at targets, shooting trap, or hunting can be enjoyable. While I've never hunted, I've definitely had a lot of fun target shooting. I grew up in a family that owned guns, attended gun safety classes, and own a gun myself. It would be very difficult for me to give up my gun. It isn't one that I have for protection, in fact, I don't even keep ammunition at home; however, I enjoy shooting it and wouldn't want to give that up. I do believe I would be willing to give up my gun if I knew that by doing so, I would prevent gun deaths. Unfortunately, I don't believe that is the magic solution many people believe it to be.

With that said, I do believe there are more reasonable solutions that will help keep guns out of the hands of those who will do the most harm. Taking steps to limit access to guns by those who have clear mental issues or those who have ever made a threat to use guns maliciously would be a good first step. While it may be extreme, I feel that anyone who has threatened to kill another human being should lose their ability to own guns permanently. I also think it is important that we lengthen the time between when someone attempts to purchase a gun and when that gun can be sold to them in order to make sure that adequate measures can be taken to perform a background check.

My answers may not be the right answers, but when we look at gun violence in America, I think it's important that we start looking at solutions. I would happily hear any proposed solutions to limit access to guns by those who may use them to harm innocents that you have, which you feel would have less of a negative impact on those who use guns responsibly.",2,4,4,High Utility,Democrat,correct,2,57.333333333333336,71,60,3,2,3,Republican,1,1,6,3,3,85,85,71,71,50,70,correct,1,258,dcf0eb22,2.9144486692015192,2,4,4,2,4,4,57.333333333333336
"With racial tensions rising all across the world, we must adopt strict gun control laws to protect the future of our nation.  If we allow the laws to exist as they do today, we're effectively putting guns into the hands of all the groups who are trying to tear this great nation apart.  I believe stricter gun laws would make it more difficult for these groups to further gain political momentum, and curb the threat they pose to our safety.  Let's make it more difficult for them to legally obtain weapons, and imprison those who illegally possess such weapons.

"Gun laws should be stricter because the original premise of gun laws as applied today with modern weaponry is absurd. The idea that individuals with no experience or training in warfare can organize and rise up against modern governments who have howitzers and tanks and drones. 

Likewise guns, specifically automatic weapons with a high rate off fire are pointless for personal protection and lethal in the hands of a psychopath. With numerous school shootings, mass shootings, and general rage killings. A significant loss of life could of prevented if these kinds of weapons are difficult or impossible to obtain.

Having guns in the home also causes significant death in the people who own them. Especially  children who aren't taught safety or are taught to glamorize gun violence.

These are the major reasons why gun laws should be stricter",3,2,4,Low Utility,Democrat,correct,2,58.333333333333336,97.5,0.5,7,4,6.25,Republican,0,1,6,3,3,79,92,100,95,0,1,correct,0,260,978f3d6b,-11.08555133079848,3,2,4,3,2,4,58.333333333333336
"Stricter gun laws should be in place so as to simply prevent more gun deaths. Instance of guns used as self-defense are much less common compared to instances of murderous shootings. Stricter gun laws would allow still allow people with clear background checks to own guns. It's too easy to own a gun currently, contributing to more people owning guns who in reality shouldn't be qualified for one. 

Certain guns/magazines that are commonly used for mass murder should also be banned. There's no reason why someone should have or be using these higher power guns. It can also be tempting to use guns when in fact a situation does not call for it. Even highly trained professionals such as the police struggle with this, let alone the average Joe. If two people are in a quarrel over road rage for instance, one of them may be tempted to make use of their gun in a fit of anger.

"The 2nd Amendment gives us the right to bear arms.  I'm completely okay with that, and I believe that everyone who should want to own a gun should.  However, I think there should be some stricter guidelines because the 2nd Amendment does not say people need to own automatic assault rifles as a form of protection.  Yes, you will argue with me on this, but I ask you to listen to my thoughts before making up your minds.

There should be stricter gun laws such as closing gun show loopholes and really enforcing universal background checks.  I'm sure you will not like that and will question, who's going to pay for that, etc.  I believe that if someone can apply for a driver's license, job, or similar, the same standard should be applied to gun ownership.  There should be an automatic program set up or a universal database allowed for gun shops to be able to quickly run these checks.  As for gun shows, the individuals there should be held to a stricter standard.  If they are caught violating and illegally selling guns, stiff penalties should be imposed to deter said behavior.  Of course, this is all contingent on Congress passing stricter gun laws.

My final thought, think of the families that have been ripped apart due to gun violence.  Yes, it may not personally impact you, but what if it did?  Would you change your mind if your son, daughter, father, mother, or another family was senselessly taken from you in an act of gun violence?  I suspect it may change minds, but it won't change minds until it directly impacts the person who can sway legislation.  We have too much gun violence in the form of mass shootings and other isolate events, and these things needs to be curtailed to save lives as opposed to continuing to lose them.",3,3,3,High Utility,Democrat,correct,2,43,42.5,31.5,4,2,4.25,Republican,1,1,4,3,2,68,59,34,51,50,13,correct,1,262,1beb6363,-5.085551330798481,3,4,3,3,3.5,3,43
"Recently we have seen a lot of protest and rioting it America, this in itself shows the importance of being able to obtain and have guns. We are watching rioters and protesters tear America apart, they are ruining local businesses and harming innocent civilians. How many innocent lives have been taken because of these so called ""peaceful protest?"" Homes are being broken into cars are being broken into. We need to be able to defend ourselves as well as our families from those that want to harm us. 
The fact of the matter is it doesn't matter how strict of gun laws we make in America, criminals will always be able to obtain them illegally, they don't follow laws as is what makes you think they will comply to strict gun laws? By making stricter gun laws it's taking away the ability of Americans to defend themselves if needed. Gun laws vary by state, some are stricter than others, I find it interesting that we are seeing all this looting, vandalism, violent protesting in areas that have some of the strictest gun laws.
As a young woman with children I find it especially important to be able to protect myself as well as my children if need be. The best example I can give about why we need less strict gun laws is a situation that actually just happened a week ago in the city I live in. I woman went to a local restaurant with her husband and two young children. The husband went inside to grab the food while the woman and her two children waited in the car. Not long after the husband left the woman stated that two younger looking men approached her car, one on the driver side door and the other on the passenger side door. They proceeded to pull on the door handles to get into her car, luckily for her not only were her car doors locked but she was a gun owner in the state I live in it is perfectly legal to have a gun in the car with no permit  She pulled her gun and as soon as the young men saw it they quickly fled. Ask yourself what would have been the outcome of this situation if this particular woman didn't have a gun because of harsher gun laws?

I feel the only purpose for a handgun is that it is easily concealed, and it designed to shoot another person. You would never use a handgun to go hunting. Also, high-powered, semi-automatic rifles should only be used by the military, not for the general public. Once again, you do not need these types of guns to hunt or protect your house.

"We should absolutely have stricter gun laws in America. School shootings are an American problem, and this problem needs to be dealt with. Other developed countries also experience domestic terrorism, however these attacks are more commonly stabbings or cases where someone is run over by a vehicle. While all of the above incidents are tragic and horrific events, school shootings result in a much higher number of casualties, and these events target our youth; future Americans with hopes and dreams are having their lives cut tragically short by gun violence.

It's because of tragic incidents like these that I fully support stricter gun laws in America. This problem is not going away, but is instead ramping up, and people are starting to become numb to it. I think we need to look more at an individual's psychological state when they want to purchase a firearm. There are also less restrictions on buying guns at gun shows specifically, and this needs to change. People that are mentally unwell are able to easily purchase a gun as our laws stand now. There's no reason why responsible gun owners should disagree with more rigorous background checks for someone buying a gun, as responsible owners are not the problem at all. It's unstable people that are flying under the radar and causing all of this pain for our country. We can do better as a nation to avoid tragedies like these in the future.

"I can definitely see the argument that Democrats make in wanting stricter gun laws. It looks as if it's so easy for people to obtain a gun now a days, with all the mass shootings in schools and on the streets around the states. However, I believe there should be less strict gun laws because I do believe people have the right to arm and defend themselves. If the only people who have guns, in this country, are criminals then that leaves the rest of society without any protection. It's in the constitution that we have a right to own a gun to defend ourselves. Furthermore, I believe that even if we were to make gun laws more restrictive, the criminals out there, who do most of the deadly shootings, are still going to be able to obtain a gun, no matter how strict gun laws are. So, these criminals will still be able to get their guns, illegally, while the citizens are unarmed.
Guns don't kill people, people kill people. If we have stricter gun laws, then criminals will find other ways to do their killing, whether it be knives or explosives.

They also did so with the mindset that was familiar with the weaponry of their day - even the most advanced firearms available during that time.

If we keep all these things in mind for today's world, it then follows that a reasonable approach to setting policy for gun ownership would adhere to those same guidelines: every owner should be of sound mind, have safety in mind, and possess only those weapons necessary for hunting or protecting oneself.

Since our population is now many times larger than when the Constitution was written, we need more comprehensive laws to ensure that these measures are preserved.  In order to do that, our laws should insist that (1) background checks of all types available are done for anyone purporting to own a firearm; (2) military-grade weaponry is made available to only the military or law enforcement; (3) registration of all firearms purchased is mandatory.

It is a persons right to own firearms.  Most people who own firearms are responsible law abiding citizens who mainly have them for protection.  Stricter laws will not make a difference.  The ones who should not have firearms are the ones who dont follow the rules and will still have access to them and use them for the wrong reasons.  Making the laws stricter only hurt the people who follow the rules and actually go through the correct process to own a firearm.,1,3,3,Low Utility,Republican,correct,1,47.666666666666664,77.5,62.5,3,3,3,Democrat,0,1,2,3,2,75,65,75,80,50,75,correct,0,311,9867bc29,6.914448669201519,1,3,3,1,3,3,47.666666666666664
"Right now in the United States there are a plethora of gun laws that prohibit the sale of firearms to those deemed ""dangerous"" or ""unstable"". Over the recent years I've hear of the so called ""gun show loophole"" that so many people like to tout about. Realistically gun shows are comprised of local businesses that practice the same gun sale regulations at the gun show as they do in their own stores.

Fact of the matter is, is that if someone is determined to obtain a weapon to use in harmful manor they will do so legally or otherwise. So what would happen is there would be a mass un-armed population who abide by the law and a mass population of criminals who do not. We would then be defenseless. 

The old argument is that you don't need weapons because the police or other forces will protect you. Now there is a mass movement to defund the police who would then the last line of defense to yours or your loved ones safety. Seems like an oxymoron to me.

What we need is a comprehensive realistic gun laws.

"Those Democrats who want stricter gun laws are looking for change in the level of violence in the country.  That is something both sides of the argument can agree on. This country is far too violent and we need to come together to find real solutions to this problem. Making gun laws more strict seem to be the fastest solution to the problem.  In reality, however, that's not at all the case.  Making gun laws more strict has the potential to increase instead of decrease violence.

Guns are simply tools.  They are a dangerous tool, yes, much like a knife, power tools and your car.  Guns are used for sport like hunting and competitive shooting.  Guns are also used for personal protection.  No tool is perfect for personal protection, but when the element of surprise is not on your side, it's the only tool that even has potential to get someone in trouble back home to their family alive.  If gun laws are to be changed to affect change in the level of violence, it's mental health and the family unit that need to be addressed, not gun laws.

Mental health and building strong family units are topics that are much harder to address to come to a solution on what laws are best for the country.  Should a mentally disturbed person have access to a gun.  Of course not, we all agree on that.  Should a person who was mentally disturbed a decade ago, but who has successfully completed treatment have access to a gun.....well, this is where it gets hard and needs the full attention and cooperation of experts from all angles.  Personally, I don't have answers to all the questions, but I do know for certain that more strict gun laws will not control violence, it won't even make a dent in it.  Let's work on mental health, let's work on making family relationships strong first.  If we can work together to get that done and in practice, I think you'll see that gun laws had no significance in the first place.",2,3,4,High Utility,Republican,correct,1,21.666666666666668,50.5,47,2,1,2,Democrat,0,1,3,3,2,31,33,54,47,34,60,correct,1,313,80406035,4.914448669201519,2,4,3,2,3.5,3.5,21.666666666666668
"I believe that gun laws should be stricter based on a regular Republican talking point: that guns are accessible to people illegally, no matter the law. The fact is, those guns were sold legally at one point. Depending on the age of the gun and the length of ownership, the gun laws that were in place were much looser than they are now. Some folks bought guns without even having to register them. Now those guns are in possession of people who may not even have bought them, registered them, or even know how to properly and safely care for them. They may have been handed down, or they may have been resold before the Brady Bill was passed.

So the current owner may have no safety training, no current registration for the weapon if a crime is committed with it, and no idea how to deal with those situations if they present themselves. Republicans say they are strong on law and order, but if a crime was committed against them, with such a weapon, they may never see justice.

"The vast majority of gun owners are law-abiding citizens. Regulations on gun possession should be based on preventing firearms from reaching parties who should never have been in possession of a firearm, not from those who have clear and valid reason for owning a gun. At the same time, clearly there should be restrictions on weapons that there is no real reason to own. No person needs an assault rifle for personal protection.

"It's completely understandable that people feel the right to own guns. Security, self protection, property protection, protection of those we love, those are all valid reasons to want to arm yourself. However, I feel that current gun laws are often too lax.

There are many places in the country where you can walk into a gun shop, make a purchase sometimes with very little to no background check, and walk out armed either immediately or after a short waiting period. There is often no requirement for safety training, proper handling, not even an assessment if you're physically capable of operating the gun safely and properly. Think of a person feeble or weak trying to shoot off a heavy weight, heavy caliper firearm. All too often I see people doing open carry or even ""concealed"" carry (if it's concealed, I shouldn't know you're carrying) who don't have the firearm properly secured - anyone could grab it from them. Or people carrying in shoddy holsters poorly placed on their body, a situation that could easily cause a wild shot to themselves or a bystander if they tried to draw in a crisis.

It would be better if gun laws were consistent across the country and a bit stricter than they are now in most places. Not eliminating purchases, but screening purchases to better keep them out of the hands of criminals, people with mental health issues, and keep people from buying more gun than they can handle. Make licensing consistent, requiring training on basic safety, handling, and use.",2,3,3,High Utility,Democrat,correct,2,38,52,38.5,3,2,3.75,Republican,1,1,5,3,2,62,50,50,54,34,43,correct,1,316,c95b09bc,4.914448669201519,3,3,2,2.5,3,2.5,38
"First of all, no one is trying to take your guns away from you. That is a ridiculous, fear inducing argument that has been played over and over throughout the past several decades without ever a shred of proof. Why do you think that argument has been used? Do you think maybe it is to induce fear in order to sway your vote? 
If you look at the recent history in our country of mass shootings, of the number of innocent children killed, most people can agree that we have a problem. Conservatives tend to say it's not a gun problem, it's a people problem, that religion can fix it. Unfortunately that is not a valid argument as we live in a place with freedom of religion, with people from multiple different cultures and backgrounds and we will never all follow a singular religion, so that's not a relevant solution. 
Having stricter gun laws is not going to take your guns away from you if you are a healthy, able-minded, law abiding individual, so why does it upset people so much to discuss implementing these laws? I would be perfectly willing to undergo a stricter background check, a psych evaluation, even longer waiting periods or whatever else can be decided upon in order to own my guns if it meant that people who have no business owning guns because they are a potential threat to the safety of others can't have theirs.

We as a society need to recognize the fact that we will never be able to prevent all people who have bad intentions from causing harm to others, but one step in working to correct our current path is to tighten our guns laws around access to purchasing and acquiring firearms. This would greatly help to mitigate the likelihood of a mass shooting and therefore would preserve American lives.

Similar in the way that you must have a driver's license to drive a vehicle, there should be a requirement of a firearm license prior to purchasing a gun. This license would have to be renewed every so often and would require thorough background checks along with firearm training and safety courses. This would allow law enforcement officials to have a better understanding of who is registered to have access to firearms and would help to make sure that the firearm owners are being trained appropriately to use guns in a safe manner.

"The right to bear arms doesn't need to be repealed, but rather negotiated. I understand that some people have a specific need for the ownership of a gun, but I will list two reasons why stricter gun laws need to be implemented. 
The first is that guns are being utilized by bad people for bad things. For example, people are obtaining AK47s and walking down the street, open-carrying them. Others are using them for hate crimes and claiming self-defense. Others are opening fire on crowds at concerts and high schools. There is no reason for a human being to open carry a machine gun, or any gun outside of a handgun for that matter. 
The next reason is because big machine guns and automatic weapons are more dangerous to the owner, rather than the person receiving the gunshot wound. For example, people are more likely to harm themselves or somebody they are protecting, rather than the perpetrator in an instance of using the gun. 
I do acknowledge the use of generalization in my statement, as not everyone who owns a gun is irresponsibly. Some owners are proper users to guns and would suffer from stricter gun laws as a result. So, I offer a negotiation: ban semi-automatic and machine guns, but allow handguns to be owned and open-carried.

Both are deadly, but one is designed specifically for taking a human life. Yet, guns are sold nonchalantly at your local retailer without much ado. This is a defect of our society, and needs rectification.

Stricter gun laws create an environment that values human life over some cultish veneration of life-taking instruments. It would give people who need guns in rural areas the tools with which to hunt, but would block mentally ill and those with prior criminal records the access to a weapon they would use with the sole purpose of taking a life.

"One of the most common arguments for less restrictive gun laws is that it allows for law abiding citizens to stop a shooter with equal force. However, this is only possible with proper training and knowledge of firearms. When faced with a deadly situation, most people will feel a sense of panic and disorientation and without any training they will be ineffective at using a gun to take down a shooter. For this reason, it is actually beneficial that gun laws be changed to require firearm safety courses. Making gun ownership require a modicum of responsibility benefits everyone. A knowledgeable gun owner could actually be effective at protecting their fellow citizens. This is not something that is likely when people use guns like cool accessories and don't even have basic skills like proper trigger discipline. Gun laws that implement training requirements will make everyone a better gun owner. 

Another major influence that making gun ownership dependent on taking safety and training classes is that gun owners would be better equipped to save a loved one from an accidental shooting. The most tragic aspect of widespread gun ownership is when a child is accidentally killed because gun safety was not properly established. Everyone would agree that limiting these accidental gun deaths is desirable and increasing the number of responsible and knowledgeable gun owners would be a major step in that direction.",3,3,2,High Utility,Democrat,correct,3,1.6666666666666667,15.5,20.5,3,1,3,Republican,0,1,5,2,2,2,2,6,25,20,21,correct,1,336,a85bb665,12.91444866920152,3,4,3,3,3.5,2.5,1.6666666666666667

"I believe we should have stricter gun control laws. I think this way for several reasons. It is important for children not to be able to get their hands on guns, it would prevent dangerous people from getting guns, and it would make society as a whole safer. To begin, children should not be getting their hands on guns. It is too dangerous and children are the future. If they get guns, it would cause chaos and a lot of trouble. I would be very upset to hear children got their hands on a gun.

Next, it is important for dangerous people not to get their hands on guns. Those who are mentally ill should not have guns. They may believe whatever anyone tells them and take it out on society. This would be a huge issue for everyone. Those who are mentally ill and dangerous should not be able to purchase a gun and we need much stricter gun laws.

Lastly, stricter gun laws would make society as a whole safer. It is imperative to keep society safe.

"The most immediate evidence for need for tighter gun control has been plastered on recent US national news.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, a right-wing agitator was followed and murdered by a left-wing gun 'enthusiast'. Police murders in the USA are caused in large part by the incredible quantity of firearms held not for hunting or survival, but for ""fun."" Your rights as a gun enthusiast, to play judge, jury, and executioner, should not supersede the rights of the actual silent majority to a peaceful, murder-free life.

"Gun violence is a problem in this country. While the right to bear arms is an important right, it needs to be preserved in a way that does not result in an environment where it is too easy for guns to fall into the wrong hands. Criminals are able to obtain guns they should not have access to, and children are able access guns they are not able to handle safely. We need to work together to address this problem, because it affects all of us.

There are many ways to strengthen gun laws that will prevent the gun violence we are seeing without infringing on law abiding gun owners. Universal background checks would close loopholes that criminals use to obtain guns legally, but would not prevent others from obtaining guns. Voluntary buy back programs would remove many guns from the streets. Requiring the quick reporting of stolen firearms would help in tracking down criminals with stolen guns. Additional safety measures could prevent accidental shootings by children. 

If we work together, I am sure there are many other measures we can come up with to lessen gun violence without infringing on the right to bear arms.

First, if there are stricter background checks involved with the sale of guns it is less likely that guns will be in the hands of people who should not have guns. There are many loopholes to buying guns, for example at gun shows. By passing a background check, it is less likely that those who do buy guns will be criminals or those with histories that may engage in mass shootings or just shootings in general. 

Finally, if people have less access to automatic weapons there would be less mass shootings in the US. Banning the sale of ARs would decrease the amount of people that a shooter could kill quickly at one time.

"Stricter gun laws would benefit everyone in society. The idea that absolutely anyone should have the right to purchase a firearm and then carry it in public, whether concealed or otherwise, is patently ridiculous when we hold it to any kind of scrutiny. It is the ridiculousness of that idea which has led to the gradual adoption of certain checks being put in place in some areas of the country.
Think for a moment about whether a sufferer of bipolar disorder with a history of manic and depressive episodes - leading to documented violent outbursts - should have as much right to obtain and use a gun as someone who does not suffer from a mental disorder. The logical answer is no. We know that they have a history of violence, and we also know that they suffer from a disorder that leads to poor decision-making. The reasonable position is to agree that at the very least mental health checks should be a minimal requirement for possession of a firearm.
Society tends to view felons in the same way. When someone has a violent criminal past we often remove their second amendment right to possess and bear arms - a logical conclusion and consequence of their past behavior.
It follows therefore that, clearly, some degree of laws are needed in this arena. The subtlety comes in the nuance of what those laws state. I am not advocating a ban on firearms, I personally own a gun, but I know that I am an emotionally stable and calm person. Can you argue that you are able to personally vouch for every single gun owner in this country? I know I cannot, and therefore would appreciate it if someone would at least look into their personality to some degree.
What is being said is that we need stricter checks, that review national databases, to catch people with a likely propensity towards violent or unstable behaviors.

The fact is that countries with stricter gun laws have fewer mass shootings--New Zealand, Japan, Great Britain.  Nothing is going to totally stop mass killings (except perhaps mental health programs).  People will still manage to kill en masse with rifles and pistols and knives.

"When it comes to the issue of gun laws there are a lot of heated debates about this issue.  I for one stand that gun laws should not be any more strict than they are. There are multiple reasons as to why gun laws should not be any more strict. You have to think of the issue of guns as the whole picture not just the stories we hear about from the media every single day. One must be open-minded and think about the good that guns can do, not just the harm they can cause if placed in the wrong hands. 

For one, a gun when placed in the wrong hands can lead to catastrophic events, but think about if a car ends up in the wrong persons hands. I think about a person that has been drinking getting into a car and driving. That person is no safer than a dangerous person with a gun and yet driving laws are no more strict than they have been before. If you make gun laws more strict the bad people that use guns for bad things are still going to find ways to get ahold of guns and use them to create chaos and tragedy. Why make it so much more difficult for others that are good people that have guns only as a means for self defense and the wellbeing of their families to have to jump through a million hoops to have a gun when the dangerous people will still find ways to get those guns? If the good people don't have those guns who will take care of the people that are creating these tragic events. Finally, guns don't kill people, people kill people. I know you have heard this phrase a million times, but it is so true.  A gun can't go off by itself, it has to have someone to pull the trigger.

That is what we must focus on.

Stricter gun laws will not help with crime. This is because criminals will still be able to get their hands on guns. Stricter gun laws will only keep guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens.

"Gun laws are often a hot topic due to the mass shootings in this country, and the high crime rates when compared to other nations.

"The evidence shows that more guns equate to more gun violence. The evidence also shows that less regulation results in more gun violence. The inclusion of gun rights in the constitution of a nation has led to the U.S. to have more gun violence than any other first-world nation on earth, every year and counting.

If you think any of this is untrue, you could immediately muster up counter evidence to any or all claims stated. Name another first-world nation that has higher gun violence than the U.S. Explain why gun rights should be enshrined in law and use peer-reviewed evidence citing its tangible benefits to the nation. Also, explain why the founding fathers even bothered to allow the second amendment into the constitution.

The arguments for guns are mostly talking points. First, there‚Äôs zero evidence that the founding fathers wanted guns rights as a solution to totalitarian government. If they wanted that, why did they allow a vote? Why kill if you can vote out bad people? If guns are needed to overthrow government, then the American experiment has failed. Hence, you‚Äôre no better than a failed stated. Again, prove this was the intention of the fathers.

Guns should be heavily regulated and or banned completely because you can‚Äôt name a single tangible reason, backed by peer-review, that proves a need for gun rights.

Crazy brings me to the matter of the legality of semi-automatic long guns, such as the AR-15. These guns are designed to powefully shoot a lot of bullets in a short amount of time. They serve no purpose other than to shoot a target to shreds, or to shoot people to shreds. In open carry states (that's a whole other bizarre case of gun logic), people can not only buy such guns in minutes, they can walk around their neighborhoods, terrorizing citizens with their mere presence, as intended.

"Courts have consistently upheld gun ownership regulations (preventing felons from owning guns, forbidding bringing firearms into schools, etc.) and the Second Amendment, according to the courts, does not guarantee the right to private gun ownership but rather the right to a militia. In countries that have enacted stricter gun restrictions, such as Australia and England, the laws have resulted in a reduction in mass shootings and gun deaths overall, including homicides and suicides. Guns are also rarely actually used in self-defense - less than 1% of violent crime victims protect themselves with a gun, despite the fact that gun owners make up about 20% of the U.S. population. The ""good guy with a gun"" narrative is also flawed, as a civilian with a gun is more likely to be killed or injure an innocent bystander than kill an attacker. Furthermore, the presence of a gun itself is likely to make a conflict become more violent, according to research conducted by the FBI.

One month later he decides to stop taking his medication and sees his 6 year old daughter as a rabid dog on the living room floor. He gets his gun and shoots, killing his little girl. 
 Had a further background check taken place, they would have seen that this man was in fact a patient in a state hospital for several months due to vivid hallucinations and acting out violently toward them.

"The US Constitution affords this country‚Äôs citizens the right to bear arms, as such we are indeed a nation of mostly responsible gun owners who are well within their rights to possess their weapons.  We also have a problem with gun violence that we need to address in some way.Not one of us wants to see another school,shooting, another mass murder, or even a suicide of someone who we know is living with deep pain due to mental illness. We therefore need to find a way to allow responsible gun owners to fully exercise their constitutional rights and yet protect our citizens from those who would trample on that right and abuse it to harm others or themselves.

The Ways we enact these changes need to be the least burdensome possible on those citizens who own weapons responsibly and without incident .   Many suggestions have been tossed about over the years and some have been enacted over a short time period or are supported by the vast majority of our citizens including law abiding gun owners.  For example, we all agree that a felon who has used a weapon in the commission of a crime should lose the right to own weapons in the future.  While this limits the right to bear arms it has no real consequence for those who exercise their constitutional right responsibly.

With this in mind how we proceed as a nation needs to largely look at limiting access for those with criminal backgrounds, those who threaten others with violence, those who have a mental health issue, and those who are either too young or in some other way incapacitated in a way that makes their ownership of weapons unsafe for society as a whole.  No law abiding gun owner wants to see those who intend to or In some way have larger capacity toward committing violence or acting irresponsibly owning a weapon that is dangerous or deadly when in the wrong hands.

"There are many reasons to own a gun: hunting, target shooting, and personal protection. The issue that arises is that not all guns are equal in their destructive power. When hunting, a person needs a low magazine rifle, usually only shooting 1 to 3 bullets at an animal before they either are hit or they run away. A gun used for personal protection really only needs to be a low caliber low magazine pistol. The issue is that people will buy high caliber, high capacity assault rifles that can do mass damage to a group of people. There is no justification for this type of gun ownership.

People who own these types of guns are looking to use them. The republican party has pumped it's followers full of a false narrative that dangerous people are at their doors and they need to be very afraid. This is simply not true. We as a society have a certain social contract in place that prevents this type of dangerous behavior on a mass scale. I will concede that crimes happen but if someone needs a gun for self defense. They can have something that does hold 50 rounds and fire automatically.

You can ªt drive a car without a driving test, insurance, and wearing a seat belt and those that do are liable for fines or imprisonment.

"Being in favor of less strict gun laws has it's cons. For one, Democrats believe that the less guns there are out there, the less violence there will be. I think that to be false because there are many other ways for people to do harm. If someone has an intent to kill, it does not matter if they use a gun or not, they will kill. I also believe that when people have guns to protect themselves, it will help reduce violence. If someone knows another person has a gun for protection, the attacker will be less likely to attack. If teachers or principals in schools had guns, it would be easier to prevent a mass shooting.
I also believe that people should have the right to own guns because that's what make America the country that it is. The second amendment allows for people to carry guns.

"Stricter gun laws do not equate to quashing your Second Amendment Rights nor do they mean that anyone wants to take your guns away. Stricter gun laws simply mean making sure that firearms are in the hands of people who can use them safely and legally. Most people in the United States would agree that they do not want anyone unnecessarily harmed by a firearm through accident or intent. 

We know that in many of the mass shootings there were red flags to show that the shooter had mental and emotional problems. In some circumstances they even indicated their desire to do harm to other people. There has been a failure within the law enforcement community and the government to share this information and address it. If there were laws and avenues for these people to be given help and restricted access to firearms, there would be a whole lot of people still alive today. 

Red flag laws are imperative. A misconception surrounded red flag laws are that anyone can make a complaint and you will lose your gun. This is simply not true. Most red flag laws that have been proposed include due process. Do we worry that people are going to acuse us of committing crimes and that we will automatically go to prison? No. Why? because our legal system is set up to ensure due process to the accused. The same would hold true with red flag laws.

Guns are everywhere.  Not only do we need stricter gun laws, we should completely ban guns for civilians especially automatic ones.  There is absolutely no reason why civilians need automatic guns.   Name one reason.  I cannot think of one.  There is no reason to mass kill people at all for any reason.

I would like to say to completely not manufacture guns but since humans already invented guns, the damage is already done.  Humans are destroying each other.  Even if there's a ban on guns, criminals and people will find a way to obtain one.  Stricter gun laws will help slightly but it's better than the way it is now.

"OK. So this is (a start) for what I have to say to Republicans who support less strict gun laws:

Let's start with, first off: do you REALLY want to live in a country where everyone's armed?? What if we, as a nation, could actually all agree that LESS people had to be armed?? It could actually be possible to have far, far less gun violence if everyone could just agree to a buyback program, etc., 

Consider that Great Britain doesn't even arm its police, w/guns -- can you imagine how less violence and assumed violence there would have to be in the line of duty??? All Lives could really matter. Consider countries like New Zealand, where, besides the more recent horrific mass shooting at a mosque there, their deaths by gun violence are truly few and far between -- because they just simply don't see a point to living in a society fueled with and by violent weapons.

And, I know, the argument -- ""but I want to arm my home."" Sure, fine, go ahead with a shotgun, even a glock -- but little high school kids dead on the floor of their homeroom?! How sick ARE you as a party -- because it is YOUR party that is continuing to allow this to happen, and refusing to let the rest of us move into the 21st cent. How sick ARE you as a party, some of you ascribing to the theory that the Sandy Hook shooting didn't even occur; or, ""Fu*ck that one shooting survivor girl from Parkland -- she's just some stupid f*cking d*** anyways.""

And if you really are so disgusted and horrified by mass shootings -- then why don't we actually expletive TRY something to fix the problem?? And if Democrats' ""extreme"" answer -- less guns in the hands of civilians, and even the police -- really doesn't work, then I guess your Republican-controlled senate, sans filibuster, can pass legislation to arm everyone to the teeth, incl. kindergarteners?!

--

But, not only all that: Republicans (you!) fail to acknowledge that the majority of Democrats ARE NOT EVEN IN FACT THREATENING TO GET RID OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT!!! That is just more fodder you buy off the Fat Orange Slob and all his leathery orange lizard cronies, because it's what you want to hear -- doesn't matter if it's actually true!! And also true case, for those of us who are interested in Real News: reliable (can you imagine that? not ""fake news!"") polls that show that the majority of Americans, even Republicans, are in favor of at least SOME stricter gun legislation!!! (i.e., more extensive background checks, etc.,).

--

And don't even get me started on how, it is in fact KIND OF ANTI-LIFE (NOT PRO-LIFE!!!) to be so lax about letting so many people have guns!! As I personally do not find a moral equivalency between a teenager taking Plan B right away after unprotected sex (would that it were more easily and readily avail., so later-term abortions weren't happening as often -- but I digress!!) -- and shooting up a movie theater, shooting up a school, shooting up a night club, shooting someone IN THE BACK MULTIPLE TIMES you're trying to arrest who is resisting 'cause maybe they don't want to go to jail, shooting into a crowd of protesters <-- bcuz, before they're just ""thugs burning down buildings""...maybe they're also just people on a street exercising the same right all you morons have, refusing to wear masks to protest your right to be slaves to your jobs rather than demanding the gov't. provide reasonable unemployment during a pandemic with a disease that is, no, not just a hoax or the flu, but literally a very easily communicable death sentence for a lot of people?! Do you REALLY hate your life that much that you don't care if you or others around you die?? Again, with your insistence on being pro-life...

--

And, one other thing: the majority of Democrats are also REALLY MOSTLY KEEN ON GETTING RID OF THE ASSAULT RIFLES!!, @ least as a start!!, as THOSE are what have committed the most atrocious mass shootings in the last 5-10 years!! Bump stocks ban is a slow-clap start (but, oh no! We can't have gun manufacturers or the NRA losing money now, can we?? That would just be godless atheism). But, if y'all are really going to deny that your violent, bloodthirsty, yet call yourself Christians who yet hate the poor grifting off your paychecks --- maybe we could actually IMPLEMENT REAL CHANGE INSTEAD OF JUST DEMONIZING THE ""MENTALLY ILL""

TURN OFF YOUR FOXNEWS AND READ A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES AND 1984 (HINT: DEMOCRATS AREN'T THE RATS) AND AN ACTUAL NEWSPAPER PLLLEEEEAASSSEE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD Your hatred envy snot nose is pathetic. as is your pigheadedness -- a refusal to consider any kind of change, because it would mean admitting that your thought process is possibly completely ass-backwards. That, you are a truly embarrassing testament to how brain dead our country is, for those of us who bothered to take school seriously, and could just let black people be black people, and maybe even let them have their share of some decent standards of living.

BECAUSE WHERE DOES THIS END IT DOESN'T END AS LONG AS REPUBLICANS REFUSE TO STOP BEING STUBBORN LITTLE PIGHEADED CHILDREN, too ignorant and Stockholm Syndromed by their slavemasters to consider everyone, themselves included, to be entitled to even slightly better quality of living.

In recent times there has been and incredible amount of crimes committed against people that had nothing to do with the persons doing the crimes. For example the shooting in Las Vegas and the shooting at the Wal-Mart in El Paso just to name a few. People used guns in both places to kill a lot of innocent people.

It is reasonable to expect individuals purchasing a gun to pass a criminal background check to ensure they do not have violent offenses in their history, or outstanding warrants for their arrest. 
Furthermore, there is currently a loophole that allows sales at gun shows to transact with no background check. Anyone can enter a gun show and purchase any gun they want, along with a cache of ammunition.

This check could weed out those that are mentally unstable and should not own a gun.

Every day people have no reason what so ever to have these such guns. These guns can kill many many people in a very short length of time.

Since you can't monitor who has a gun, it's a good idea to let stores place some regulations on who can get a gun who's just as qualified as you, to own one. Don't let others randomly buy guns when they don't know as much about them as you do.
In addition to not knowing what they're doing, letting anyone buy a gun also give you a bad name when they misuse it. Then have to start the argument all over again.

More laws will just complicate the existing laws that we have and make it harder to enforce.

While I understand why Republicans are against this view for reasons such as protection, 2nd amendment right, and it doesn't reduce crimes. The benefits for having stricter gun laws far outweighs the cons that such a policy would bring. 

Guns do not offer as much protection as people would believe. Situations where guns can make a difference are filled with high tension and stress. Most people would not be able to accurately and steadily pull out a gun and aim without potentially harming others. These high stress situations can often lead to innocent people being hurt and the person with the gun causing more damages than being helpful. The 2nd amendment right also does guarantee each American to have unlimited and uncontrolled rights to obtain guns, there should be more regulations in who can and who can not own guns. Finally, gun control does limit the amount of crimes. The majority of crimes in America are gun violence and limiting the number of people with access to guns or making it harder for these individuals to get guns through background checks or stricter regulations would keep America safer.

You should especially want to prevent them from getting their hands on high powered weapons because of the potential damage they can do.

The more often we allow these instances to occur, the higher the chances are that there will be extreme restrictions on guns. Humans tend to simplify things. It is extremely likely that we get to the point where the consensus becomes ""all guns are bad."" We have to make the effort now to have tighter restrictions on who can carry firearms.

"Our current gun laws are outdated. They were made in a time when the world was much different, not to mention the guns were much different. Many people needed guns in the past because they didn't have quick access to law enforcement. They needed them for protection for their homes and against animals. Current times are much different. We can easily call for help with these problems. We live in a world were technology makes it possible to get help quickly. There isn't a need for militias like there was in the past. If you need a gun for protection these days, you don't have a need for guns that are intended to be used in war. 

We also have a problem with gun violence. Mass shootings are increasing every year. These are often times caused by individuals who shouldn't have had guns in the first place. Our right to bear arms has gotten so political that the NRA can bully politicians into not passing laws protecting the individuals of our country. They are manking it harder to take guns out of the hands of people with mental and violent backgrounds. Many of the current mass shootings have been done by people with mental and violent pasts. I can only imagine the lives that could have been saved if the people were never allowed to get the gun in the first place. 

I am also concerned with the current trend of people carry firearms. I don't believe guns should be brought into public situations. I don't believe someone who has no training will be able to deescalate a problem with their gun. It also makes it hard to know who the responsible gun owners are. Just because you own a gun, doesn't mean you are responsible. Many gun owners have accidents because of poor practices. It concerns me that the person sitting next to me in the restaurant is as safe as I would like them to be. Guns are not like vehicles.

I don't want any other parents to have to go through the horrific pain of losing a child in a school shooting or any other loved one in a mass shooting event.

One of the simplest ways to prevent gun violence would be to enact stricter gun control laws, which could mean doing something as simple as requiring a more extensive background check. I know that most gun owners are normal people who don't have anything to hide, so having to undergo a background check before buying a new firearm shouldn't be an issue for the average person. Think of all the mentally ill people we could potentially detect through these checks, which would prevent them from purchasing a gun. How many shootings could we prevent this way? If the answer is even one mass shooting prevented, I think it's worth it and I imagine that you probably do too.

I want to also respectfully point out that wanting stricter gun control doesn't have anything to do with wanting to go against the second amendment.

     It seems that there is something new and horrible to watch on the news every day. Anti-protesters shooting and running over protesters, police shooting people in the back, and so on. It's no wonder that crime rates are accelerating at historical levels. The citizens of this nation are exhausted, upset, running out of money, and in fear of there lives. If COVID doesn't get you, maybe the police will, or some crazed ""militia"" person with an assault rifle will.
     The point to all this is, we are seeing a tidal wave of crime and distress across the nation. People have been threatening each other with guns, and some even shooting people. More and more people are becoming afraid, which is causing gun sales to skyrocket. With so many guns being put in the hands of people that may have a mental illness, in desperate need of money, and mentally stressed, I fear that we will have an epidemic of shootings in the coming months. People will target affluent people to get their money and possessions, angry people will start shooting others out of anger, mentally ill people will take their guns and go on shooting rampages out of paranoia.

"Listen, nobody wants people to get hurt, I'm sure. You simply see guns as a way for people to not get hurt: they allow people to protect themselves from threats. This is so important to being American that it's enshrined in the Constitution, right?

Here's the thing. The numbers cannot lie here-- people are far more likely to hurt themselves, either intentionally or accidentally, with their own firearms than it is for them to defend themselves effectively with them. The United States is the only developed nation where mass school shootings occur. It's hard to think it's a coincidence.

It's also important to understand the Constitution in historic context. It was written in the late 18th century to avoid the abuses the Founding Fathers saw committed by the British government. Guns at the time would have a hard time hitting the broad side of a barn. And the Constitution was meant to be re-evaluation and changed every fifteen years. We haven't done that. Simply put, the Constitution does not support the ownership of assault rifles without restriction by everyone. They're meant to be owned by a well-organized militia who have received training. The social context has changed, so the Constitution is meant to have changed as well... only, it hasn't.

"Are you aware that, in our state, since March of 2020, there has been an all-time record number of gun sales? It's true.  In the past six months, more first-time applicants have been approved for weapons than at any other period in the 100 year history of our state police, whose gun division controls the application and sale of handguns, long guns and automatic weapons.
   There have been so many sales that American gun manufacturers are running out of weapons to distribute to dealers. Runniing out of guns to sell, when Americans already own over 450 million weapons. 
   Our state police have seen annual surges in gun sales before, typically in the spring, when people get tax refunds, or on Black Friday, when weapons are purchased for deer hunting season in our woods.  But gun sales since March, 2020, have far surpassed these previous surges.
   In the past 100 years, residents of our state have endured flu and polio epidemics, the threat of invasion during World War II and the Cuban Missile Crisis. But never have we purchased guns in these number before. Why?
   A global pandemic, the loss of millions of jobs, a severe economic downturn, unrest in the streets, a divided nation stoked by a fear-mongering administration, and police brutality all are factors.  The inability of Congress in recent months to pass a 2nd stimulus package has also contributed to people's decision to take matters into their own hands.
   Now more than ever we need to recognize that stricter gun laws are needed in every state to control the misuse, not only of legally purchased weapons, but illegal weapons as well.  35 states use an automated gun sale system that is seriously flawed.

Stricter gun laws would simply ban from our streets guns that should belong to the military, not those people hunt with or can shoot at the range with.

Also, the criminal penalties will be an added deterrent of those willing to risk getting caught.  We know we can pass effective gun legislation because we've already done it in the past!!

But compared to other countries, a truly enormous number of Americans die from being shot each year. We should at least try to lower that number. We should be smarter about our gun laws, there are small things we can do to make a real dent in how many Americans die each year. Of course, background checks get all the media attention, and I do think those would be beneficial. But suicide is the biggest killer.

Essentially you will be taking away weapons from those who obtain them legaly.

Seeking stricter gun laws is not only encouraged, but necessary in order to protect those on either side of the firearm.

Too many people with mental health issues are able to obtain firearms.  They should not have the ability to acquire a firearm, since they may not be able to make appropriate or well thought-out decisions on how to use those firearms.  People are obtaining firearms that are not keeping them locked away safely and innocent children find them, and then end up discharging them, either killing themselves or others.

We have seen numerous instances in the recent past of people with serious mental health issues easily obtaining dangerous weapons and using them to commit mass murder. And I think most people agree that letting people with mental health problems have easy access to powerful guns is a recipe for disaster. The question is how to safely filter out people who can easily become lethal if armed with firearms while letting people with no known history of mental health issues or criminal activity have access to firearms.

If you can't be bothered to feel any of those three feelings yet, well, I don't think you're responsible enough to own a machine that can so easily take someone's life away. And if you want that power, you shouldn't get to have it without the structure of gun control behind it.

The Second Amendment that you venerate so much calls for a ""well-regulated militia."" Skipping over the fact that said militia was created in place of a standing army, and therefore the fact that the US has a large peacetime army and police force /should/ render the militia unnecessary, THAT should be the standard.

In order for the government to protect its citizens effectively, gun laws must be put into place in order to restrict certain individuals from obtaining firearms.

The importance of gun laws is impossible to understate. Suppose that somebody obtained a firearm, and they had a history of mental illness, and they harmed a loved one of yours. Would you feel that stricter gun laws might have prevented the tragedy? And, if you felt that, would it mean that you were wrong, even just a little bit? Would you change your mind?
Asking oneself these questions is important, every bit as important as gun laws themselves, because it allows us to use our sense of reasoning and imagination in cooperation to visualize why we might be wrong about our opinions. To see that one is wrong, one needs to use the mental tools they have been given. Conversely, to realize the right way to go about things one must use said tools.

Sadly guns are a a necessity, not only for hunting if you choose, but for protection, just ask any of my liberal friends who were scrambling to obtain a gun once COVID hit.  But if we could tighten up the means to get one and limit the type of weapons available (assault, etc) perhaps this could reduce the amount of causalities when a mass shooting event occurs.  Since we're not in the middle of a war zone, I don't feel that the weapons that a soldier would carry are necessarily needed on city streets.

In their argument they miss critical facts and are therefore lying with statistics.  The truth is that in countries where gun ownership is less than ours or where they are not allowed to own guns there is no difference in violent crime.  In fact the violent crime numbers show that the removal of guns made no difference at all.

Criminals will not give up their guns and removing the guns from law abiding citizens leaves them defenseless.  In countries that got rid of guns crimes such as burglury and home invasion increased.  This is because the criminals did not give up their guns and knowing that people were defenseless they felt empowered to start a crime wave.

These individuals will be the ones that shoot their partner/spouse, their parent that angered them moments ago, their neighbor that tool their parking spot one too many times. This access to guns is not something our country needs. 

We also need to keep our children and those around us safe. Too often are guns stolen from rightful gun owners and used by criminals or children who have not learned to properly handle a firearm.

Certain firearms are more practical than others for protecting one's home as well. Specifically, semi-automatic and sub automatic guns can not be honestly considered a weapon for defense. They are intended for firing rapidly, and thus killing or harming many. These are not weapons we need in our community. Handguns are questionable as well, due to how easy they are to hide and sneak into places such as schools. A shotgun or bolt action rifle will allow you to present a physically threatening display to would-be attackers of your home/family, but no don't have the rapid destructive capacity of a handgun or rapid fire type weapons.

Furthermore, stricter gun laws will enable individuals interested in recreational gun use (such as at shooting ranges or hunting) to feel safer. They will be able to trust that their fellow shooters and hunters have gone through the proper training and use of firearms because of the laws in place preventing the purchase of firearms by untrained people.

Consider that laws are only as good as those who follow them.  When it comes to threats of personal safety, you don't have to worry about a law-abiding citizen.

If there are more strict rules on gun control then there would likely be fewer school shootings. This would make people less likely to want to ban guns altogether, and would save lives.
Having strict gun laws means that when you have your gun, you won't be as afraid of other people having a gun that shouldn't.

    It is okay to feel the need to own a gun, as is our constitutional right, but we do not need to own military or automatic style weaponry, that can cause so much pain and damage in short amounts of time. Often, people are allowed to purchase guns who are mentally unstable and unfit to own weaponry in general.
    We need better background checks that are deep, in order to ensure that people who are mentally unstable, do not attain a weapon.

It didn't become more difficult to get a vehicle when these laws were instated, but it did become safer on the road for other drivers knowing that everyone was trained in safe operation of that vehicle. Knowing that the people carrying firearms are trained in operation and are licensed to carry one makes me safer.

hunters use guns as tools but they are trained and licensed, as all gun owners should be. drivers are licensed, pilots are licensed as should gun owners be. making it harder to get a gun would go a long way in making sure only those qualified and stable could have access to guns and therefore make all of us safer.",3,2,2,Low Utility,Democrat,correct,3,17.666666666666668,32,65,2,1,2.5,Republican,1,4,5,4,2,20,32,29,35,79,51,correct,0,691,c00c5799,-16.08555133079848,3,2,3,3,2,2.5,17.666666666666668

It is a fact that the lack of accountability that the NRA has taken in these shootings, means that they do not care about their consumers.

"It is understandable that a lot of people favor unrestricted gun sales. After all, many people were raised with guns in the house, have gun ownership, hunting, and legal shooting as part of their family values and history. A hunting trip with a parent or a first gun as a gift are rights of passage and signs of adulthood for many.
Without taking away from those cherished family traditions, guns have become more lethal, with larger capacity magazines, faster firing semi-automatics, and better accuracy of inexpensive weapons available to too many. Combined with increases in poverty and mental health issues, guns often easily fall into the hands of owners not able or willing to control the.
So, some limits on who can buy guns to prevent ownership by the mentally ill and to better prevent ""straw"" sales would be in everyone's interest.

Most of the guns purchased by people who end up on the news for shootings do not purchase their guns through legal means.  Restricting gun laws will make it harder for those who are following the law to obtain firearms.  The people who commit mass shootings and do harm to others have no intention of following the law.  Restricting gun laws will mean nothing to them since they don't abide by the law to begin with.  

Another group of people who could possibly be stopped by stricter gun laws are people who commit accidental shootings.

"There are a few reasons I believe we should have stricter gun laws. The first reason is historical. Many arguments in favor of looser gun laws argue that the right to bear arms is delineated in the bill of rights and is thus constitutionally protected. However, an examination of historical documents confirms that what was meant by ""arms"" when the Constitution was written is not what is commonly meant today. The founders and citizens of early America could not have conceived of assault rifles, for example. In fact, the founders were very wary of having a standing army of citizens who felt it was their professional duty to be ready at all times to wage war: the founders felt that this would create instability and a dangerous proclivity toward war in the populace. The founders wanted citizens to have the arms necessary to protect their homes and families from invaders and wild animals; they did not intend for citizens to have weapons capable of perpetrating war, which is what assault rifles are.

The second reason is that many of the stricter gun laws proposed by members of Congress would not actually interfere with the sort of gun buying most Americans engage in. Proposed gun laws include things like mandatory background checks, wait periods, and mental health screening. These sorts of regulations would ban people who have documented histories of domestic abuse, for example, from buying guns. Nonviolent citizens would not be affected by such laws at all. I believe its unlikely that most advocates for gun rights would agree that a domestic abuser should be able to go out and buy an assault rifle any time he felt the need for a weapon. Thus, I believe that most advocates for gun rights would support stricter gun laws that would prohibit this kind of thing.",3,2,2,Low Utility,Democrat,correct,2,60.333333333333336,97.5,90,1,1,1.5,Republican,1,2,4,3,2,80,100,95,100,80,100,correct,0,753,9bb48961,-2.0855513307984808,3,2,2,3,2,2,60.333333333333336
"Gun laws are a highly debated topic within the two major political parties and beyond. One reason that both political parties should support stricter gun laws is that they will ensure that guns do not fall into the hands of the wrong people. By regulating gun sales very strictly, there will be less occurrence of people with severe mental illness or those who have in the past committed violent crimes owning guns. These people should have to give up their right to own a gun because it is in the best interest of public safety for those who may be capable of being dangerous to not own guns.
Some may say that strict gun laws would make it harder for everyone to own guns, even those who are qualified to own guns, and that guns are important for providing safety.

Currently, our gun laws are a good start in trying to ensure responsibility, but as we've all seen in recent years, the number of mass shootings have drastically increased.  This is due to the ease of which mentally impaired individuals are able to get their hands on guns and the fact that they can get easily discharged automatic weapons.  It is too common that for a disgruntled citizen to acquire a semi-automatic rifle that can inflict mass casualties and unleash all of their anger and frustration on innocent civilians.

In looking at National tragedies where unstable individuals were able to easily acquire firearms and kill helpless individuals, I can certainly see your point of view. I see that you want to help stop those situations from occurring in the future. 
One of my biggest concerns with this approach is that the more strict gun laws will be more effective at stopping law-abiding citizens from procuring firearms to protect themselves from break-ins than they may be at stopping criminals. Oftentimes perpetrators of these tragedies are not the owners of the guns they use. They may find firearms on a black market, purchase them illegally on the street, or even steal from a family member. While it might seem prudent to restrict gun purchases, those policies will affect law-abiding citizens the most. A thief or a criminal, on the other hand, will still be able to steal or illegally acquire a firearm.
While I certainly understand your opinions and can sympathize with them, I would ask you to look at things from a homeowner's point of view, a homeowner who wants to be able to protect themselves from a thief and a criminal who may try to attack them using a firearm that they acquired illegally regardless of restrictions.

"A government that governs least governs best is what we are taught in secondary school. While perhaps not every student had the fortune to study Thoreau's Civil Disobedience, these words are still applicable today. This country was built by are founding fathers based on a very concise list of principles, with the right to bear arms listed second in our bill of rights. To deny Americans their ability to defend themselves is to deny what this country means. Instead of stripping the rights of Americans, we should be focused on the real issue‚Äìmental health. Guns do not kill people. People kill people. If we stop people from wanting to kill others, then the issue of gun violence would no longer exist, and this can only be resolved by funding efforts towards mental health.

Additionally, laws are only good when they are followed and enforced. It seems the areas with the most gun laws have the highest amount of deaths from guns. From this, we can surmise that laws are ineffective even when put in place. The places with the least amount of gun laws have the least amount of crime.

"I do realize that there have been many circumstances that have arisen recently where crimes with guns have been committed.

Such thoughts play on one's mind to come up with a solution that would allow themselves and loved others to face such happenings. I see that its easier for one's mind to show oneself how they could avoid such happenings to an extint. But things get much tricker when trying to interept the minds and intent of others outside of oneself. The least resistantant way to do such is to prevent others from obtaining the thing that one think is empowering them. And in this case enters the thought of strict gun laws, I understand.
I too would think first towards taking that empowerment from others, with the thought of strenghtening myself by lessing possible fatal threats from outside of myself. This would allow me to live more freely. Or will it? You see, we are quick to veiw the instances where guns are in the hands of the wrong indivisuals, but we neglect the imagining of guns in the hands of the right people. (Right people are anyone with the RIGHTs to do so) I too when feeling the way you feel force myself to entertain the other side of the coin. Think for a second, the very indisuals that wrongly used guns thought themselves to have the right to what the gun would bring, and pretty much there is little to no resistance. These types of folks that exercise a selfish point of view slip through cracks that are not sealed. One great way to do this is by allowing reasonable and safe gun laws that allow great indivisuals to carry them.

While it's true that gun crimes are lower in those countries, the culture is the bigger factor. In many countries in Central and South America, there are also much stricter gun laws than those in the USA. However, in those countries, gun violence is much higher.

Cocaine in the USA is illegal, and yet we are the number one consumer of cocaine in the world. Much of that flows through the southern border.

It must be acknowledged that murder is already illegal, but hasn't stopped the gun violence. Passing a law against a gun in a particular area, or specific location, will not stop someone who is already intent on breaking a much stricter law - the one against murder.
Stricter gun laws will affect the people already obeying laws. Then, when that person who has already decided to break the law against murder, steps into the school with a law against guns on campus, and uses that gun against the law-abiding who left their guns at home.

This isn't saying that any person can take the class online; of course criminals and those who would be considered dangerous to those around them, would not be able to apply for a conceal carry.

"It was a warm Summer night in June. As I quietly got myself into bed after a night spent out places I wasn't supposed to be, I hear the sliding door to my Grandparents' house shatter. As fear and panic started setting in, protecting my elderly guardians became my main focus. As any naive teenage know it all would, I ran towards the sounds of intrusion, armed with little more than my words.
   It wasn't too long after I stood face to face with the two intruders my Grandmother emerged from the hallway. At that moment it was a stalemate. We all stood staring at each other, evenly opposed except for the fact my grandmother and I were staring at the barrel of a gun. I didn't want to mention my grandfather was present, but where the hell was he?! Why are two women, barely 100 pounds soaking wet a piece, standing here and not him? The short answer? Because he still had his wits about him. Being an army vet, he knew exactly what to do and how to keep his reactions in check. The 4 of us stood there waiting for the other to make a move, but the intruders were losing patience and began to make their move.
   As the robbery started to progress, I heard a loud SLAM!! A diversion, my grandfather was putting his plan in action. As the robbers rushed us, a disorienting light began to strobe. Where do I go? Suddenly I was lost in a home I'd lived in for years. That was the plan becoming a success for him though. I was slammed into a wall and brutally kicked and tossed around like a rag doll and suddenly it all stopped. I heard a loud bang and saw the muzzle flash. You know what it is when it happens, there's nothing else it could be. Kind of like the smell of death, you just know. I saw a figure fall and I remember I just started to hysterically sob. I thought in that moment that this wasn't over and now I have nothing to try to protect my grandma with. Except my brain misread the experience, it resulted in an emotionally charged confusion once I saw another figure running away.
   As the lights came back on I hid. My grandmother and I literally were hiding under a bed trying to not make a noise. As I hear my grandpa calling 911, my nerves start to settle. We sneak out of our bunker, and approach nervously. The intruder with the gun was sprawled out on the floor, grunting and yelling in pain. The gun he'd held to my face, lay on the floor halfway down a 12ft hallway. As the story began to unfold to the 911 operator, I remember the feeling of gratitude sweeping over me.

A few questions must be asked. When it comes to weapons, what are the current laws in place? One of the pushes is the ban of assault weapons, but many do not know that automatic weapons already have a ban on them as one of the nine prohibited weapon types. If there is a ban already in concern to automatic weapons then what additional laws would curb those who are illegally obtaining the weapons in the first place? Another question to ask is about research of demographics where the highest amount of gun violence occurs. What laws are already in place in such places like Los Angeles, Chicago, New York?

"I feel there should be less strict Gun Laws because if we allow citizens to carry concealed weapons it will steadily decrease violent crimes.
Criminals tend to attack unarmed victims more violently. But with less strict gun laws mostly many people will start possessing concealed weapons.Criminals will be deterred by the risk of attacking armed victim.

"The second amendment is the law. It will always be the law because it is written into our Constitution, and no one can change that. The framers wanted to always guarantee our right to forever bear arms, if only to protect ourselves and our families from enemies foreign and domestic. Democrats in positions of power, those able to create and uphold the law know this to be true, and they know that the law cannot and will not be altered. So as much talk as there is about ""Democrats wanting to take guns away from the people"" is just that- talk. Mostly made up by people literally afraid that their constitutional rights as Americans will be stripped away from them. The fear is real to them, as it should be. But in a country where our Constitution is held dear by lawmakers and the Courts- it will never happen.

What is being asked by lawmakers is not that radical. The technology of weapons- like the technology in computers and many other machinery and electronics, has evolved faster than the ability to examine it in our society. Many of the people that own weaponry that has the capability to out 'gun' the user will even attest to the fact that some weapons do not need to be on the street. We found that out with 'cop-killer' bullets in the 1980's. Bullets that could pierce the armor of police officers out their to protect all Americans. We didn't confiscate all the guns to help with this problem. Democrats and Republicans worked TOGETHER to ban the use of the ammunition rather than the gun. One principle of our nation, along with the Constitution, is the ability of real leaders to come together in COMPROMISE to come up with solutions. That actually helped to create the very Constitution that protects us and gives us our freedom as Americans. 

We can do that again for the issues with advanced weaponry today. It is a matter of pride that we have always come together when our country needed us to. And we can do this again to help to solve this problem. Without the partisan rancor, without either side creating fear or distrust. Precisely because we ARE Americans and we have a history and a duty to endure. To create a better world for the next generation. To have hope for our future.

This is not about the second amendment.  No one that thinks there should be stricter gun control is wanting the second amendment erased.  What stricter gun laws mean, is to have common sense.  To trace guns, to know when a household has a ton of guns in their home that can trigger a tragic event.  If one is a hunter, two to three hunting rifles ought to be plenty for that purpose, and if more is needed, then there is no harm in having them fill out information as to why.  home defense can be one gun.  Why have multiple?  Then there will be enough guns to sell on the street or get stolen and used on people, which will mean more and more deaths.  The cavalier attitude about human life is not ok.  Stricter gun laws is not doing away with the second amendment, but rather, being able to decrease gun deaths throughout the country.",3,2,3,Low Utility,Democrat,correct,2,36.666666666666664,42.5,30,2,2,3.75,Republican,0,4,5,1,2,53,55,40,45,60,0,correct,0,893,b9e4162b,12.91444866920152,3,1,3,3,1.5,3,36.666666666666664

In America, a child is more likely to be shot, accidentally or intentionally, in their own home. Most of those incidents are due to children playing with unlocked weapons found in their home. If we could pass laws in all 50 states that insure gun owners are required to purchase a lock for their weapon and are educated on how to use it, it could significantly reduce the amount of children that are shot and killed in this country. 

People who live in homes where they have access to firearms are three times more likely to commit suicide. Suicide attempts made with firearms have an almost 90% chance of succeeding. Depression rates for children and teens are on the rise for all races, in almost every state. If we could keep guns out of the hands of teens and children by insuring that the guns in their households are secured with child proof locks and loading indicators, we can make sure our kids won't die before they get the help they need.

"Guns have been part of our society since its infancy. They served important purposes back then. First they were used as a weapon to protect people and their communities when war was almost certain from the British and Indians (and a few others). The people were also weary of their own government and felt that if the population was armed then the government could not easily suppress them. They were also a tool for hunting which was an effective means to secure meat and other parts of the animal.
But as time has progressed and we have become a more civilized society, we no longer have to worry about hunting our own food, the constant threat of Indians and the British are one of our closest allies. We have not fought a war on our soil since the civil war and wars around the world between large nations has come almost to a stop. Our priorities have changed. We rely on commerce, trade and mutual self interest to keep the peace. 
So why are we the most heavily armed civilian population in the world today and one of the very few first world countries that has not yet disarmed their civilian population. Politics will answer that question. We have found it to be an acceptable trade off between mass school shootings, countless other mass killings and even individual shootings hundreds if not thousands of times a day, just so we can keep buying more and more weapons, which will go on to repeat the cycle. Unfortunately our current political atmosphere is corrosive and much to divided. We need to try to figure out how to properly educate people about guns and then start figuring out how to get most of them out of peoples hands in a safe and civilized manner.

That way, they can aggressively pursue any criminal elements that still trade in guns, without having to worry about their constitutional rights. Speaking of which, it is worth noting that the idea of an individual, constitutional right to gun ownership was only codified in the 20th Century by the Supreme Court, and is still very controversial to legal scholars. It was a divided decision, and a common-sense reading of the second amendment makes it clear that the right to gun ownership was only meant to apply to state militia, which we don't really have today--the closest analogues would be the National Guard or police forces.",3,1,4,Low Utility,Democrat,correct,2,33.666666666666664,38,28,1,1,1,Republican,0,1,5,3,2,50,50,35,41,31,25,correct,0,919,23c09a5b,-2.0855513307984808,3,1,4,3,1,4,33.666666666666664

How can we prevent these criminals from having unfettered access to deadly weapons while not infringing upon the rights of law-abiding citizens?

"I live in a small, rural town in Alabama. My family has had the opportunity and right to own guns for many years. While I generally feel safe going shopping in my home town, I don't always feel safe visiting the neighboring town of Huntsville, which is loaded with crime and criminal activity. My husband has a pistol permit and whenever we leave our home, he is carrying his gun. Knowing our little family is protected gives me a feeling of calmness and a sense of peace. I know we are safe and well-protected.

There is a lot of meth use in the small community where I live. I feel like all, if not most, of the crime we have can be traced back to drug use. Most of the burglaries are drug-related. People do not care whose home or property they trespass. They are merely looking for items of value to sell. We have several handguns in our home. My husband and I are both licensed to own and to carry these weapons. As a woman and mother of 5 children, having protection in my house makes me feel better. My husband works in law enforcement and often works nights. I am home alone with my children. Being that we live in a small town, it takes quite a while for the county sheriff's department to answer calls to my neighborhood (especially if their only car is on the other end of the county). We are often left waiting for 30 minutes to an hour or longer for law enforcement to respond. In an emergency situation, I would be able to protect myself, my family, and our belongings that we have worked too hard to acquire.

I don't believe guns kill people. People kill people. Gun violence is due to the actions of individuals who are using guns. Having tougher laws will not deter gun violence. People who use guns to kill and in criminal ways will still find a way to acquire guns. Tougher gun laws will only make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and their families.

"I understand your stance on something as serious as gun laws, since firearms are extremely dangerous in the wrong hands, we have seen that countless times over the course of the last 10 and even just the last 5 years honestly with all of the mass shootings that have occurred within our very borders.  The atrocities that some people have done with firearms is truly disgusting and tragic, and so I know all too well why people would want stricter gun laws or to abolish the right to bear arms completely in this country.  Despite the fact that I am republican, albeit a weak one, but still a republican regardless, I do still understand the views of the democrats on this topic, stricter gun laws could help to keep more people unarmed, but are those the people that would perform these atrocious acts?  

Now that I've explained why I understand your side of this, let me explain my side of this argument of why I believe that the laws should stay the same as they are now; one thing that I always go back to is the laws aren't that well enforced now, if we added more of them, there's no guarantee that they would be enforced either, and so more laws would just be more time wasted by the politicians that they could be using for other issues that may actually get enforced.  That's one reason, another is that the people that are committing these acts of terror, in my opinion, are acquiring their firearms illegally, outside of the laws that are in place now, and probably would still acquire them illegally if there were stricter ones, and so in my humble opinion, the laws do protect the innocent, but they can also hinder the innocent from defending themselves against those that have illegal firearms, because the innocent may not be able to acquire firearms through legal means if the laws became stricter.  There are good people out there with firearms that only use them for hunting and home defense, but stricter laws would hinder those good people from acquiring their firearms legally, which is also tragic to me because I know of one case where people that were legally concealing their firearms in a church were attacked by an assailant that had illegal firearms on them, and these good churchgoers ended up taking out the assailant, I think we would see more people just brutally slaughtered with no way to defend themselves if the gun laws became stricter than they are now.

My apologies for making this so long, I just am passionate about my stance on this just like you democrats are passionate about your stance on it too.

"I understand the concern about guns and the gun violence in our nation being a catalyst for change.  I do support the idea of keeping guns out of the hands of people who  have proven themselves to be dangers, such as felons.   I do support the idea that guns should be registered to an owner in order to track and prevent the guns from being misused.  However banning law abiding citizens from owning guns for self defense or sport is against our constitutional rights and is un-American.  

The idea of self protection isn't something to scoff at.  Centuries of violence have proven that when a person is unable to defend themselves they fall victim and sustain  injury or even wind up dead.  The law that an individual can own a firearm for protection allows someone to protect themselves until the authorities arrive to step in and protect them.  If guns are made illegal, it won't prevent criminals from getting guns, after all drugs are illegal and drug use is rampant.  Stricter gun laws make it more difficult for law abiding Americans to protect themselves.

The  last point is that if guns never existed, if a gun had never been invented, killing would still exist.  The gun doesn't have a personality or a character, it takes on the character of the person holding it.

"I believe there should more strict gun laws because this belief serves ALL of humanity better than the alternative. The major problem with people wanting to have more lenient gun laws is that they don't want to admit the real reasons why they want to be able to own guns or as many guns as they possibly can. These reasons are where all of the problems start. These reason are that: 1) Deep down, many people feel weak, and 2) Many people feel that having the power over life and death makes them stronger in everything they do. 

People don't want to acknowledge that having a gun makes them feel powerful. This is because needing a gun to feel powerful is the absolutely WRONG reason to have a gun. This leads to impulsive decisions that one probably wouldn't make if they didn't have a gun, and leads to unnecessary loss of life just so someone can feel like God because they had the power to take a life. This is also the reason many people hunt animals. Because a person can kill an unarmed, unsuspecting animal, this makes them feel that they are more powerful than a wild beast, which in turn makes them feel more powerful than other human beings. A perfect example of human beings needing to feel powerful can be found in the types of guns they buy and number of guns they buy. A person says they need a gun for protection, but they buy an automatic rifle capable of killing many people at one time, OR a person buys several guns ""just for protection"" when they can only shoot one at a time or at most 2 at a time.

"Stricter gun laws hold the promise of keeping guns out of the possession of people who would misuse them, and of keeping them out of settings where their presence might be especially dangerous. Without, for instance, closing the gun show loophole, we retain a legal regime that allows anyone to obtain a weapon, regardless of their maturity or intent. The frequency of gun crime, in mass shootings to be sure, but also in everyday violence, demonstrates the problem with this approach. 

Some gun control advocates do want to ban handguns or even all civilian ownership of firearms. To forestall this possibility, many Second Amendment advocates feel a need to resist any additional regulation. The flaw in such absolutism is that efforts focused on other causes of shootings than the radical simplicity of legally acquiring a gun are apt to be speculative in approach and incremental in effect, even as communities experience devastating losses and economic development and social trust are badly undermined. 

Without dialogue and compromise, the only plausible expectation is that people will continue to die in large numbers, even as carefully designed regulations that acknowledge and balance the interests of gun owners and the those of public safety gather dust on the shelf.

Many people own guns that Democrats don't think about but pretend to value. Elderly people, single young women, Mom's, Professionals. People don't think about this because these people are responsible gun owners. The large majority of gun owners are responsible and law abiding. 

Like most progressive policies, unfortunately, policies that ""protect people"" end up harming those they are meant to help the most. The process of buying a gun, permitting, fingerprinting, traveling sometimes far distances to complete the task, all place unnecessary burdens on people of lower income and social status.  People with lower incomes should not have to pay large fees to have their gun ownership paperwork processed. Taking time off from work to complete the process creates an undue burden on people of low income. Women who are feeling vulnerable have to wait months for paperwork to be approved when they may be in immediate danger. 

The last point is that gun laws are so varied across the country we are only adding to an unnecessarily large prison population.

"My family and I were always raised around guns and taught to respect them, and the meaning of its use. We always hope, we'd never need to use a gun to protect ourselves. My father, wanted us all to understand how to use one, the meaning of having a gun in the home, and being responsible. We were always taught, never use a gun unless absolutely our life is in danger. 

A few months ago, my pregnant(six months than) sister was home with her three year old son. They were getting ready for the day ahead, and she started with washing him. She was up early, made the coffee, and sent her husband off for the day with a kiss goodbye. She never thought, what happened later that morning would ever happen. As she was washing her son in the bathroom, she thought she heard something outside. She shrugged it off, She thought it was one of her sons toys he was holding, perhaps. When they got towards the stairs, she heard a creeking sound outside, and she saw a shadow by the window. She wasn't expecting anyone. She put her son in her bedroom, and got her gun. She hoped she wouldn't need to use it. She looked out the window and saw the man trying to open a window, and she grabbed a drinking glass off the night table, and she threw it out on the deck to make noise, to try to scare him away. It worked, he ran away.

She said, she would have absolutely shot him if he came through the window. She was ready to defend her son, her unborn child and herself, and her safety if it came down to that. The fact that she threw the glass out the window to scare him off, shows how responsible a gun owner she is. She did not want to shoot this man. She wanted to alert him that someone could be there and he needs to leave. What happened to her could have turned out worse. Thankfully, if the situation did not go as it did, she could have defended her son and herself. No mother should be alone at home with a child and not be able to defend.

"I believe that responsible individuals have the right to bear arms. This is necessary for recreation, protection of family and property, etc. I also believe in doing things in moderation. Anything done in excess leads to negative consequences. Some of these consequences can be predicted while others may not.That is why is important to impose bigger restrictions on being able to purchase and maintain weapons.

Not all individuals understand the importance of maintaining the responsibility of guns in their possession. Their recklessness can potentially affect not only themselves and others in their household but others as well. Many, if not all, of us have heard stories from the news and/or from people we know about those who have been devastated by gun violence. A quick Google search will provide countless examples of people devastated by gun violence. Those committing the violence have been both known and unknown to the victims in these circumstances. Also, there have been examples of mentally ill individuals being allowed to purchase weapons and also children accessing weapons in their home. Both of these issues need to be revisited and requires a solution to prevent future unnecessary carnage.

To maintain the safety of everyone, I feel that it is more important to implement stricter gun laws than to provide the ease of purchasing weapons. I truly believe that I will still be able to purchase weapons needed to protect my family even with stricter gun laws. Stricter gun laws will put the burden on individuals to not only be responsible but to also maintain that responsibleness so that they may acquire weapons and continue to keep them.

"Gun control is a very touchy issue for many people. Many factors play into why people hold their particular views on gun control, ranging from upbringing, peer pressure, geographical location and personal experiences. I am sure that many studies have been done on the various factors, but I do not pretend to be an expert in that area.
I do, however, think that I may understand why some people say they want less strict gun control because of their desire to hunt, or to protect themselves and their families. These are perfectly legitimate reasons to own and use guns. No one is going to say that they want more lenient gun control laws because they intend to use a gun to commit a crime, but of course there are some out there who will.
But that is not what concerns me. What concerns me is the ever more powerful weaponry that is available today, compared to what ever could have been imagined by our founding fathers when they crafted the 2nd amendment. High powered, multi shot weapons with night vision and hollow bullets could not have been on their radar. But now we have AK47s, machine guns and many more weapons capable of far more fire power than is needed to hunt a deer or a pheasant. These high powered weapons can be used to kill many, many people in a short amount of time, and sadly, sometimes they are. While these weapons have legitimate purposes in the hands of the military or perhaps law enforcement, I fail to see why this type of weapon should be made so easily available to the general public.

Making the laws more strict is only going to prohibit many people who would be safe with a gun to not take the action to get one. Unfortunately, as we have seen with marijuana, anytime an item is made more strict it seems that they are just obtained illegally. 
With this being said, shouldn't we make it easier to obtain guns? I'm not saying that we should just hand them out to anyone. We should still require background checks and citizenship verification.

"I understand you are hesitant to embrace stricter gun control laws, but would ask you to keep an open mind and take into account the following considerations.  All I ask is that you give the subject a fair consideration, and look for a meeting ground.

I think most people can agree that there is a gun-abuse issue in this country.  Children should not be afraid to go to school (nor should active shooter drills be a normal part of growing up).  The safety of our children demands that we find common ground, that allows the maintaining of some firearms, while making military-grade weapons harder for troubled people to come by, and to promote better safe gun practices by those who can purchase them, but may be lax in gun security.

Another option would be to tighten gun sale loopholes and be more stringent in who can purchase firearms (closer background checks, psychological testing and profiling, etc.), but otherwise allow healthy, competent and responsible individuals to purchase firearms.  This could be taken further, by requiring 'military grade firearms' to be kept at a local arsenal, where they can be checked in and out by the owners.  This would allow for the possession of firearms for personal and home defense, and allow collectors and enthusiasts to continue to purchase military-grade firearms while ensuring they are stored safely and correctly.  This would fulfill the 'well-regulated militia' requirement of gun ownership enshrined in the Constitution.

The important thing is that we begin having these discussions with an open mind, and when having these discussions, truly listen to one another.

The problem with allowing easy access to guns is that they are deadly. There is a far greater likelihood of a gun being used in a manner other than intended (such as being accessed by a child or a suicidal adult), being used with the intent to protect but based on incomplete information (against someone trying to steal something because their family is starving rather than trying to hurt anyone), and so on.

It is often said that the best defense against a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, yet, mass shootings are still happening almost daily. Their absence from the nightly news is more a result of a low body count rather than a decrease in actual incidents.

Republicans have championed for fetuses' right to life, repeatedly emphasizing the need to legally restrict certain ""freedoms"" in order to save the innocent's life. While it may sound like I'm ramping up to condemn this mentality and shame Republicans for this line of thinking, I actually am going to do the opposite and say that yes, sometimes restricting individual freedoms for the greater good of saving innocent lives is both moral and necessary. That's why I am in favor of legislating stricter gun laws, and that's why you should, too.

The second amendment guarantees the right to own firearms, essentially defining gun-ownership as a basic ""freedom."" I will not disagree with this idea but will rather accept it as such. Sometimes, though, restrictions of freedoms are necessary when it can save innocent lives from harm, as Republicans have repeatedly established in their case against abortion. The same goes for the case against lenient gun laws.

There are people who support lax guns laws even after learning that dozens of elementary school students were gunned down by a mentally impaired person who had access to guns. They will even call reports of the slaughter 'fake' to justify their views. Then they will suggest that we just arm all the teachers, janitors, parents, to ensure that any potential attackers are scared off. But such a suggestion is intellectually dishonest when you realize there are teachers, janitors, parents, who are themselves unstable. The vast majority of people who still support lax gun laws simply wish to live in a more violent society, regardless of the larger cost. I get it. 

They even support lax gun laws after learning that a white supremacist visited a black church and gunned down several worshipers there. It fair to ask whether support for lax gun ownership laws is by default a racist. Or that they hate cops, after learning that more police were ambushed by a random passerby who shot into their vehicle. 

But all these arguments have been heard before. And still people want their guns. And they disregard the ramifications of allowing most everyone else access to a firearm.

The best persuasion is to elect representatives who will change the laws, recognizing that we don't need to persuade everyone. Some will never be persuaded.

Another such change could be closing the loophole that allows people to buy guns without background checks at gun shows.

By having less strict gun laws people will be able to register for guns and obtain them. This will allow law enforcement time have a better idea of those who have fire arms in their possession.

"The simple fact is that it is too easy to obtain guns in this country. Higher numbers of gun owners lead directly to more homicides, in part because gun owners are encouraged to use them to signal strength. This often leads to confrontation and the discharge of a firearm. 
With more strict gun control laws like a national registration database, universal background checks, and mandatory training people who seek to own a firearm would be more equipped to handle it responsibly. People with a history of violence or mental illness should be denied the opportunity to own a firearm because of the likelihood that it will contribute to harm.
Certain weapons should never be in the hands of civilians. High powered semi-automatic rifles are weapons of war and are designed to do as much damage as possible in a small amount of time.

I believe that education is the key, as I believe that a lot of people who want more restrictive gun laws simply fear what they do not understand, as I believe that many of them have never even held a gun, rifle or pistol in their hand.

"I understand why you may think that our country would benefit from stricter gun laws. No one wants dangerous people to own guns. We see horrible things happening in the news day after day and it is very reasonable to want gun violence to decrease. To be honest, I just don't think stricter gun laws are the answer for that, at least not in our current society. People who live in rural areas rely on guns for hunting and protection (from malicious humans, but also from dangerous animals). The police can take hours to reach their houses if something happens. I don't agree with most Republicans on this issue. I am not paranoid that the government will become tyrannic or that we should bear arms simply because it was written on a piece of paper ages ago. I support safe gun laws because I think the government doesn't adequately protect part of the population and that law-abiding citizens should, in this circumstances, be able to protect themselves and their loved ones. I want to highlight I am writing this with an open mind. We may disagree on gun laws, but we are all citizens of this country and we are in this together.
